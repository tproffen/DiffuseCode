1  discus

   The program is invoked by typing 'discus' at the operating system or 
   at the shell prompt. The program uses a command language to interact 
   with the user. The command 'exit' or a CTRL Z terminates the program.

   More information about the syntax, expressions etc. of the command
   language can be obtained by typing 'command' at the help prompt.

   Help on the program is obtained by typing "help" or "help <command>" to
   get specific help on the command <command>. The command may be abbreviated.
   If the abbreviation is not unique, only the first help topic that matches
   the command is listed.

   The first line of the help text gives the syntax of the command that is
   explained in the following lines. For a few commands the syntax line is
   repeated for different set of possible parameters.

2  News

   Here you find a list of recent changes, additions, bug corrections

3  2013September

   The chemical short range order in mmc can now sort groups of 
   atom types. 

3  2013June

   Finally this is it! DISCUS is now a fortran2008 program. Most of the
   substantial changes should not affect the user (or so we hope).
   Most of the large arrays are now allocated automatically, as needed,
   thus the need to compile DISCUS with different size versions should
   no longer exist.

4  Command_line_options

   The command line may now take the additional option:
   program -macro <macro_name> [<par1> [ <par2> ...]]
4  Electron

   DISCUS now offers electron diffraction in the kinematical limit as well.
   Atom form factors are taken from Table 4.3.2.3 Int. table Vol C (2006)
   respectively. from Peng, Ren, Dudarev, Whelan Acta Cryst A52 (1996), 257

   Electron diffraction works in all menues where you could switch between
   X-ray and neutrons i.e.: fourier, powder, rmc, pdf
4  internal_storage

   DISCUS now offers an internal storage of crystal structures.
   Simply start the file name with the string "internal" and
   DISCUS will write the crystal structure into a dynymically
   allocated internal data structure, instead of onto the hard disk.
   If a structure was written into an "internal" file, it can be read
   as well with ==> 'read'.
   
4  mmc

   The mmc menu can now offer a new "repulsive" energy, and may use
   the connectivity list to find interacting neighbors
4  powder

   In previous versions, DISCUS would write an unevenly spaced powder 
   pattern if you used a Q-axis and a 2Theta output or a 2Theta axis
   and a Q output. This has now been replaced by an evenly spaced 
   output. 
   If you use a Q-axis with proper Q-range, you also need to 
   specify the 2Theta limits on which you want to write the data.
   Likewise for a 2Theta axis, you need to specify a Q-range for the
   output. 
   This change mostly affects the DEBYE equation. Internally, 
   DISCUS always uses an evenly space q-grid, as the calculation is
   faster. With this bug fix, the output will be evenly spaced, for
   all combinations of axis and output.
4  connectivity

   This new menu allows you to define settings for the connectivity
   list. This connectivity list is used to quickly access neighboring
   atoms.
4  Centering

   In previous versions, DISCUS used the centering generators before
   the symmetry generators. 
   To be more in line with the International Tables, DISCUS uses now
   first all symmetry generators, followed by the centering generators.
   See also the ==> 'define' command to adjust the sequence to your
   personal taste.
4  waves

   The 'mrepl' and 'repl' commands were augmented by a "viceversa"
   option that will cause atoms/molecules to be replaced by each other 
   rather than only in one way.
3  2010sep
4  property

   A major upgrade of DISCUS adds properties to atoms. These can be
   N = normal,   the atom is a normal atom (instead of a void)
   M = molecule, the atom is part of a molecule
   D = domain,   the atom is part of a domain
   O = outside,  the atom is outside of the crystal
   E = external, the atom is close to an external surface
   I = internal, the atom is close to an internal surface

   The new ==> 'property' menu allows global settings, plot uses its local
   settings.
   The global settings affect 'replace', 'mmc', 'find env'
   Commands that add, replace, remove atoms all affect the properties.
4  surface

   The new 'surface' menu covers the old boundary command and sets 
   options to flag the atom property near an external or internal boundary.
4  domain

   A new command 'distance' similar to the corresponding one in the 
   'surface' menu allows to set distances of atoms to internal 
   boundaries. Atoms closer than these distances are flagged as "close".  
4  plot

   The default was changed to plot the entire crystal, even if the
   'ext' or 'thick' commands had not been used.
3  2010aug
4  atom_coordinates

   The user may now specify the fractional coordinates in a unit cell
   or a structure file as algebraic expression as in the example:

   Si   1.-0.2, 1/3, zpos, bval

   Remember, if you use a variable as "zpos" or "bval" in this example,
   the variable must have been defined up front and been given a 
   sensible value.

   To use this feature, it is mandatory, that the fractional coordinates
   are separated by a comma.

   The old style is still possible.

4  unit_cell_dimensions

   The user may now specify the unit cell dimensions  in a unit cell
   or a structure file as algebraic expression as in the example:

   cell alat, 2*alat, 1.0+4.0, 90.000, beta, gamma

   Remember, if you use a variable as "alat" or "beta" in this example,
   the variable must have been defined up front and been given a
   sensible value.

   To use this feature, it is mandatory, that the unit cell dimensions 
   are seperated by a comma.


   The old style is still possible.
3  2008may
4  atom_sequence

   In the original source code, the generators for each space group
   were applied strictly in the sequence as listed in the header of 
   the International Tables. 

   Thus for centered space groups, each atom was followed immediately
   by those created by the centering translations. The one exception
   are those rhombohedral space groups described by hexagonal axes
   that have a horizontal 2 fold axis and/or a center of inversion.
   Here the sequence of rhombohedral centering vectors is mixed up.

   To correct this, DISCUS now allows the user to choose whether 
   centering generators are applied first or last. The second, new
   sequence, will correspond more clearly to the printing of 
   symmetry operations for centered space groups as given in the 
   International Tables. Currently the old sequence is still the 
   default, this will be reversed in future releases. Presently
   the seqence can be defined by ==> 
!p define generator, {"center" | "symmetry"}
   which defines which group of generators comes first.
4  molecules

   A major issues regarding the assembly of molecules was corrected.
   In several space groups, molecules were not assembled correctly.
   See ==> "data keywords molecule" for further details
4  symmetry

   A new entry in the 'show' menu displays all symmetry operations
   of the current space group in a variety of formats
4  wyckoff

   This is a new command at the main menu level that determines the 
   local site symmetry.
4  define

   This new command defines several settings, just like the ==>"set"
   command does. The "set" command at the main menu level is reserved
   for general settings, common to all programs in the DIFFUSE suite.
   "define" is specific to the individual program.
3  2008april
4  formfactors
   Within the "fourier" menu, you can define your own values for
   the atomic form factors as well as anomalous dispersion correction
   terms. A "reset" was added to switch back to the internal values.
4  stacking faults

   The new parameter "list" added to the distribution mode, allows 
   you to interpret the coordinates of atoms read from the input 
   file as positions of the respective layers. 
   Previously, the parameter "file" interpreted the atom type only 
4  boundary

   A cylindrical boundary has been added.
2  Unit_cell
!b !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!b !!          NEW FORMAT OF DATA FILE, STARTING IN DISCUS-3.10          !!
!b !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   Don't worry, the old data file format is still supported !

   The new format adopts a key word controlled style of the data file.
   Except for the lines containing the atoms, each line now contains a
   keyword in the first few characters, followed by the parameters needed
   for this keyword. 
   The first line MUST contain the keyword "title", the sequence of the
   other keywords is not relevant.
   The last keyword MUST be "atoms" which starts the list of atoms.
   You may include commentaries or empty lines anywhere between the 
   "title" and "atoms" keyword.

   The keywords "title", "spcgr", "cell" and "atoms" are required, all
   other keywords are optional.

   Example

!p title Single atom structure of NA
!p spcgr Pm-3m
!p symm  1.00,0.00,0.00,0.123, 0.00,1.0,0.00,0.00, 0.00,0.00,1.00,-0.567
!p cell  5.0,5.0,5.0,90.,90.,90.
!p atoms
!p NA1+  0.0   0.0   0.0 0.1
!p NA1+  1/3, 1-0.5, 0.0, 0.1
!p NA1+  1/3, 1-0.5, 0.3, 0.1,  1

   Further help topics are:

3  title
!p title <title string>

   The title can be any character string up to 80 characters long
3  space
!p spcgr {<symbol> | no. } [, "2"]
   The space group symbol is used to generate all atoms within the unit
   cell. The symbols used should be the Hermann-Mauguin symbols used in
   Int. Tables Vol.A. A center of inversion should be given as "-" sign
   immediately preceding the axis. Lattice types need to be given as
   capital characters, mirror planes as small characters.

   Monoclinic cell choices 2,3 or unique c-axis will be assumed if the
   corresponding non standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol is used.

   Origin choice 2 is indicated by setting the optional second parameter
   to "2".

   The lattice constants are used to distinguish between rhombohedral
   and hexagonal settings.

   The space group symbol is checked for contradictions with the lattice
   constants. In case of error, the unit cell is not read.
3  cell
!p cell  <a>,  <b>,  <c>, <alpha>,  <beta>,  <gamma>
!p cell  <a>   <b>   <c>  <alpha>   <beta>   <gamma>

   The first form with comma seperating the lattice constants is 
   encouraged. Only with this format, can you use a variable instead
   of fixed unit cell values.

   Alternaticely, the lattice constants are read in free format 
   <a b c alpha beta gamma>
   All six constants must be given.

   The space group symbol is checked for contradictions with the lattice
   constants. In case of error, the unit cell is not read.
3  atoms
!p <name>  <x>, <y>, <z>, <B> [, <propertyflag>]
!p <name>  <x>  <y>  <z>  <B>

   If a unit cell is read, only those atoms in the asymmetric unit should
   be listed.
   For each of the atoms a line must be given with the name of the atom,
   the fractional coordinates and the isotropic thermal coefficient B.
   The property flag is optional. This is, however, automatically
   written to a saves structure file.

   The name (in capital characters) must be leftbound in the first four
   columns. 
   The fractional coordinates and the B value can be in free format, if the
   lines contains no comma. In this case the property flag must be omitted.
   Otherwise, the fractional coordinates and the isotropic thermal 
   coefficient B can also be specified as arithmetic expressions.

   Optionally charged atoms can be symbolized by e.g. "NA1+".
   See the help entry 'atom names' for a complete list of atoms for which 
   scattering curves are supplied.

   Empty lines in the file are ignored.
3  keywords

   The keywords "title", "spcgr", "cell", and "atoms" are required, see 
   the help one level up. These further optional keyword allow you to
   fine tune the unit cell file.

   You may include commentaries or empty lines anywhere between the 
   "title" and "atoms" keyword.

   Further help topics are:

4  #
!b #<comment>

   You can provide commands for the data file by including lines that
   start with a "#". The content of these lines is ignored.

4  title
!b title <titel string>
   The string used as title can be any character string up to 80 characters
   long
4  spcgrp
!b spcgr {<symbol>, <no>} [,"2"]

   The "spcgr" keyword defines the space group of the crystal. 
   The space group is used to generate all atoms within the unit
   cell. The symbols used should be the Hermann-Mauguin symbols used in
   Int. Tables Vol.A. A center of inversion should be given as "-" sign
   immediately preceding the axis. Lattice types need to be given as
   capital characters, mirror planes as small characters.

   Monoclinic cell choices 2,3 or unique c-axis will be assumed if the
   corresponding non standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol is used.

   Origin choice 2 is indicated by setting the optional second parameter
   to "2".

   The lattice constants are used to distinguish between rhombohedral
   and hexagonal settings.

   The space group symbol is checked for contradictions with the lattice
   constants. In case of error, the unit cell is not read.
4  scat
!b scat <name> [,<name>...]

   By explicitely listing the atom names on a 'scat' command line, you
   can define a specific sequence of scattering curves that is independent
   of the sequence of atoms found in the structure file.

   If the structure is read using the 'stru' or 'lcell' commands, DISCUS
   compares the names and atomic displacement parameters (B-values) to
   those found on the 'scat' and ==> 'adp' command lines. If an atom name
   and adp match, the atom is assigned to the scattering curve, otherwise
   an additional new scattering type is defined.
   If you read a unit cell with the 'cell' command, the scattering type
   read from any 'scat' and ==> 'adp' line will define the first 
   scattering types. All atoms that follow will be assigned to new
   additional scattering types, regardless of their name and adp, even 
   if they match the values from the 'scat' and ==> 'adp' command.

   This command is needed if you want to create a list of 
   layer type origins which are read by ==> 'stack'.

   You can use more than one 'scat' and ==> 'adp' command in the structure
   file. The number of atoms on the individual 'scat' and ==> 'adp' 
   lines does not matter, as long as the total number of atom types and
   adp's is identical. Atom names and adps's are matched pairwise using 
   the sequence with which they were read from the 'scat' and ==> 'adp'
   lines.
   Starting with DISCUS 4.0, the number of atom names on the 'scat' and 
   'adp' command lines must be identical. Thus, both commands must be
   present.
4  adp
!b adp <B-value> [,<B-value>...]

   By explicitely listing the atomic displacement parameters (adp) on a
   'adp' command line, you can define a specific sequence of scattering
   curves that is independent of the sequence of atoms found in the
   structure file.

   If the structure is read using the 'stru' or 'lcell' commands, DISCUS
   compares the names and atomic displacement parameters (B-values) to
   those found on the ==> 'scat' and 'adp' command lines. If an atom name
   and adp match, the atom is assigned to the scattering curve, otherwise
   an additional new scattering type is defined.
   If you read a unit cell with the 'cell' command, the scattering type
   read from any ==> 'scat' and 'adp' line will define the first 
   scattering types. All atoms that follow will be assigned to new
   additional scattering types, regardless of their name and adp, even 
   if they match the values from the ==> 'scat' and 'adp' command.

   This command is needed if you want to create a list of 
   layer type origins which are read by ==> 'stack'.

   You can use more than one ==> 'scat' and 'adp' command in the structure
   file. The number of atoms on the individual ==> 'scat' and 'adp' 
   lines does not matter, as long as the total number of atom types and
   adp's is identical. Atom names and adps's are matched pairwise using 
   the sequence with which they were read from the ==> 'scat' and 'adp'
   lines.
   Starting with DISCUS 4.0, the number of atom names on the 'scat' and 
   'adp' command lines must be identical. Thus, both commands must be
   present.
4  generator
!b generator g11,g12,g13,g14, g21,g22,g23,g24, g31,g32,g33,g34 [, power]

   You can define additional generators through the optional "generator"
   keyword. These generators act identical to the generators defined
   through the space group symbol. All previously generated copies of
   the atom in the asymmetric unit are copied by this generator, and will
   in turn be copied by any generators following later.

   The optional parameter power specifies whether this generator is to 
   be applied only once (default) or whether the generator is to be 
   applied again to the first image. A generator for a three fold axes must
   be applied once to copy atom x,y,z to -y,x-y,z and then again to copy
   atom -y,x-y,z to -x+y,-x,z.

   Since these additional generators are applied after the space group
   generators, you can use these generators to create non-standard groups
   or to create a set of symmetries that does not from a group.

   The generator forms the matrix algebra:

   ( g11  g12  g13 )   ( x )   ( g14)
   ( g21  g22  g23 ) * ( y ) + ( g24)
   ( g31  g32  g33 )   ( z )   ( g34)

   The generators:
!p    gene 1,0,0,0.5, 0,1,0,0.5, 0,0,1,0.0, 1
!p    gene 1,0,0,0.5, 0,1,0,0.0, 0,0,1,0.5, 1
   for example would create the following copies of an atom at 0,0,0:
!p     0  ,0  ,0
!p     0.5,0.5,0.0
!p     0.5,0.0,0.5
!p     0.0,0.5,0.5
4  symmetry
!b symmetry s11,s12,s13,s14, s21,s22,s23,s24, s31,s32,s33,s34 [, power]

   You can define additional symmetry operations through the optional
   "symmetry" keyword. These symmetry operations act different than the
   generators defined through the space group symbol or listed as additional
   generators. The symmetry operations copy only those atoms created by the
   generators. The symmetry operations do not act on copies of the atoms 
   created by previous symmetry operations.

   The optional parameter power specifies whether this symmetry operation 
   is to be applied only once (default) or whether the symmetry operation 
   is to be applied again to the first image. A symmetry operation for a 
   three fold axes must be applied once to copy atom x,y,z to -y,x-y,z and 
   then again to copy atom -y,x-y,z to -x+y,-x,z.

   Since these additional symmetry operations are applied after the space group
   generators, you can use these symmetry operations to create non-standard
   groups or to create a set of symmetries that does not from a group.

   The symmetry operation forms the matrix algebra:

   ( s11  s12  s13 )   ( x )   ( s14)
   ( s21  s22  s23 ) * ( y ) + ( s24)
   ( s31  s32  s33 )   ( z )   ( s34)

   The symmetry operations:
!p    symm 1,0,0,0.5, 0,1,0,0.5, 0,0,1,0.0, 1
!p    symm 1,0,0,0.5, 0,1,0,0.0, 0,0,1,0.5, 1
   for example would create the following copies of an atom at 0,0,0:
!p     0  ,0  ,0
!p     0.5,0.5,0.0
!p     0.5,0.0,0.5
4  cell
!p cell  <a>,  <b>,  <c>, <alpha>,  <beta>,  <gamma>
!p cell  <a>   <b>   <c>  <alpha>   <beta>   <gamma>

   The first form with comma seperating the lattice constants is 
   encouraged. Only with this format, can you use a variable or 
   an arithmetic expression instead of fixed unit cell values.

   Alternaticely, the lattice constants are read in free format 
   <a b c alpha beta gamma>
   All six constants must be given.

   The space group symbol is checked for contradictions with the lattice
   constants. In case of error, the unit cell is not read.

   All six constants must be given.

   The space group symbol is checked for contradictions with the lattice
   constants. In case of error, the unit cell is not read.
4  ncells
!b ncells  nx, ny, nz, ncatoms

   This command tells DISCUS how large the crystal is in terms of unit cells
   along the x,y and z axis.
   This is useful, if you have stored the crystal created by a previous
   simulation and want to continue work on this crystal. In order for
   fast references between atom number and the location of its corresponding
   unit cell, DISCUS must now how many unit cells were created by the
   original ==> 'read/cell' command.
   <ncatoms> is the number of atoms in each unit cell. You can determine
   this number by typing the command "eval n[3]".

   If you saved the structure, using the keyword controlled format,
   see help on the 'save' menu, you can tell DISCUS to save the number of
   unit cells and number of atoms per unit cell values for you.
4  atoms
!p <name>  <x>, <y>, <z>, <B> [, <propertyflag>]
!p <name>  <x>  <y>  <z>  <B>

   If a unit cell is read, only those atoms in the asymmetric unit should
   be listed.
   For each of the atoms a line must be given with the name of the atom,
   the fractional coordinates and the isotropic thermal coefficient B.
   The property flag is optional. This is, however, automatically
   written to a saves structure file.

   The name (in capital characters) must be leftbound in the first four
   columns. 
   The fractional coordinates and the B value can be in free format, if the
   lines contains no comma. In this case the property flag must be omitted.
   Otherwise, the fractional coordinates and the isotropic thermal 
   coefficient B can also be specified as arithmetic expressions.

   Optionally charged atoms can be symbolized by e.g. "NA1+".
   See the help entry 'atom names' for a complete list of atoms for which 
   scattering curves are supplied.

   Empty lines in the file are ignored.
4  molecule
!b molecule [parameter]

   This keyword is allowed anywhere between the atoms of the unit cell file.
   It marks the beginning of a group of atoms that are grouped to form a
   molecule.
   Optional parameters are used to specify further details. The first 
   'molecule' keyword must have no parameters.

   Molecules are used in DISCUS for three purposes.
   Regular molecules define a group of atoms that may be moved around as
           a group. The do not have to form a molecule in strict chemical
           sense but are just a group of atoms linked for convenience.
   Objects define a three dimensional object used to simulate small angle
           scattering. The pseudoatoms within the "object" describe the
           position, orientation, and distortion of the "object".
   Domains are representations of domain origins ==> 'domain'. They
           allow you to manipluate just the positions, shape, and size of
           the domains.  Once the positions are fixed, you can insert
           the structure represented by the domain into the host
           crystal.
   Valid parameters are:

5  end
!b molecule end

   The parameter "end" signals the end of a molecule. All atoms still listed
   in the unit cell file are treated as individual atoms.

5  type
!b molecule type,<type>

   The molecule is of type no. <type>. All molecules of the same type 
   can be handled together by several commands like the symmetry menu.

5  generator
!b molecule generator

   This parameter has become obsolete!

   DISCUS determines the internal symmetry of the molecule by determining the
   Wyckof site symmetry of the first atom within the molecule.

   The first atom of any molecule that lies on a symmetry element of the 
   space group must be located at the point of highest symmetry of the
   molecule. If the structure does not have an atom at this site you must
   include a "void" on this site. This could be the case .e.g. if you have
   an empty triangle on a threefold axis.

   This site symmetry is taken as the internal symmetry of the molecule.

   DISCUS compares the lists of atoms created by the space group and by the
   internal molecule symmetry. Identical sections are linked to one molecule.

   Atoms created by other symmetry operations (like lattice centering...)
   will form a new molecule of the same type.

   See the section on site symmetry in the
   International Tables for further details.
5  symmetry
!b molecule symmetry

   This parameter has become obsolete!

5  character
!b molecule character,{"atoms"|"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}
!b molecule character,{"domain_cube"|"domain_cylinder"|"domain_sphere"}

   A molecule may either represent a list of real atoms, or represent
   an extended object. The distinction is given through the molecule
   character. If the character is set to "atoms", the molecules consists
   of true atoms, and may contain many different atoms. You should 
   calculate the Fourier transformation using the ==> 'fourier'
   command ==> 'set internal'.

   Alternatively, the molecule may represent extended objects. They are
   considered to consist of continuous matter, without any further 
   internal structure. The boundary is a step function, i.e. outside
   there is nothing, inside is continuous matter of constant density.
   Their Fourier transform is calculated using analytical expressions. 
   For each of the available characters, a specific Fourier transfromation
   is calculated. Each object must consist of four pseudo atoms.
   The first atom defines the atoms, which represent the matter and
   defines the location of the object within space.
   The next three atoms represent the orientation and lengths of the
   axes of the object. If these are not cartesian, the object will not
   be the ideal object reflected by its name but a distorted object.
   Each of the axes is the 'half' axis of the object, i.e. half the
   edge length of a cube, radius and half the length of a cylinder,
   and the radius of a sphere.

   Each axis is represented by the difference vector between the 
   position of the corresponding pseudoatom ((Numbers two to four) and
   the first atom. This allows you to apply all DISCUS commands to 
   the individual pseudoatoms, thereby changing the size of the object.

   The axes refer to the base system you used in the ==> 'cell' 
   keyword of the unit cell file, or set using the ==> 'free' command
   at the ==> 'read' menu prompt. If you want to create a sphere of 
   10 Angstroem radius, centered at 0.5,0.5,0.5 in a base system 
   of orthogonal 1 Angstroem long base vectors, the entry should be:

   cell  1.00, 1.00, 1.00,  90.00, 90.00, 90.00
   molecule character,sphere
   molecule density, 5.0
   c       0.500,  0.500,  0.500, 1.45
   xaxi   10.500,  0.500,  0.500, 0.0
   yaxi    0.500, 10.500,  0.500, 0.0
   zaxi    0.500,  0.500, 10.500, 0.0
   molecule end

   
   Usefull commands to shift objects are the ==> 'symm' menu,
   to deform an object, use the ==>'shear' menu.
   New objects can be added to the structure with the ==> 'insert' menu.
5  content
!b molecule content, <type> [,<number>]

   This keyword signals the beginning of a list of content for a molecule.
   The parameter <type> gives the type number of the molecule. All molecules
   of identical type can be referred to by a number of DISCUS commands.
   The optional <number> gives the number of the molecule in the list of
   molecules. This number is written by the ==> 'save' command. On input
   the number is ignored! All molecules read via 'molecule content' 
   commands are appended to the list of existing molecule.

   The molecule content must be followed by ==> 'molecule atom' commands 
   and terminated by a 'molecule end' command.

5  density
!b molecule density, <value>

   This keyword helps you to create objects of identical volume yet 
   different scattering power. The density is expressed in number of 
   atoms per unit volume within the object. 
5  atoms
!b molecule atoms [,<i> ...]

   The atom number <i> is part of the molecule. The number <i> refers to
   the number of the atom in the current crystal. Up to 20 atoms may be
   specified on the 'molecule atom' command line.

   The molecule content must be terminated by a 'molecule end' command.

3  old_format
!b Format of unit cell data file

   The old unit cell data file contains 3 initial lines and one line per
   atom in the unit cell. All lines are in free format, beginning in
   the left most column.

!p Line 1:   Title up to 80 characters
!p line 2:   Space group symbol [,origin choice number]
!p line 3:   Lattice constants a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma

   and for each atom a line with:

!p           Name(4 characters) x  y  z  isotropic B

   Empty lines be in the cell data file will be ignored.

   Example

!p Single atom structure of NA
!p Pm-3m
!p   5.0 5.0 5.0 90. 90. 90.
!p NA1+  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1

2  addf
!b addf <resultfile> , <inputfile1> , <scale> , <inputfile2> [, <type>]

   Adds two files. The intensity of the second inputfile is multiplied
   by the scale and added to the intensity read from inputfile 1.
   Optionally the type of the input files can be given. It defaults
   to "ni" for files in the standard format. type should be "gnu" for
   gnuplot files and "1d" for one-dimensional files.

   For standard files, the respective headers are compared for consistency.
   for gnuplot and one dimensional files the h,k,l are compared line by
   line. If an error is detected, the procedure stops. Thus it is possible
   for the result files to be incomplete. They are not deleted to allow
   comparison with the input files.

   Any one of the two input files may be identical to the result file,
   while the two input files must be different files.
2  append
!b appe <name>, <x>,<y>,<z> ,<t>, <na>,<ne>, <delx> [,<dely> [,<delz>]]
!b appe <name>, <x>,<y>,<z> ,<t>, <na>,<ne>, -<bondlength>

   Conditionally inserts an atom of type <name> at the position <x,y,z>
   in crystal space. The temperature coefficient must be given.
   'appe' checks the position <x>,<y>,<z> with respect to all atoms 
   numbered <na> to <ne>. The new atom is NOT inserted, if any of these
   atoms is within the block <x> +- <delx>; <y> +- <dely>; <z> +- <delz>.
   If <dely> and/or <delz> are not given, then they default to the value
   of the last <del.> given on this 'appe' command.

   Note, that the <del.> are in fractional coordinates, NOT in Angstrom.

   In the alternative form, the eight's parameter is interpreted as 
   a bond distance. To distinguish the two forms, the bondlength must
   be less than zero. The new atom is inserted, if no atom is less than
   <bondlength> Angstrom from the position <x>,<y>,<z>.

   If the crystal is empty, i.e. n[1]=0, the 'append' command ignores the
   parameters <na>,<ne>, <delx> [,<dely> [,<delz>]]. Since there is no 
   atom within the crystal, there is no need for a comparison. Effectively,
   the 'append' command acts just as an equivalent 'insert' command.

   The parameters <na> and <ne> must be in the range 1 to current 
   number of atoms in the crystal i.e. the value of variable "n[1]",
   and <na> must be less or equal to <ne>.
   The one exception is <na> = n[1]+1 and <ne> = n[1]. This allows you
   to start building e.g. a new layer within which you would like to
   optionally insert atoms without affecting the previous layer.
   Example
   i[0] = n[1]+1
   do i[1]=1,10
     insert  al,ran(0),ran(0),0.5, 1.0, i[0],n[1], -2.4
   enddo
   This loop inserts up to 10 Al atoms in the x,y range 0 to 1 at
   z=0.5 with a minimum distance of 2.4 Angstrom. Since i[0], the 
   value for <na> is initialla at n[1]+1, all previously inserted
   atoms are not affected. Since i[0] remains fixed within the loop,
   each new al atom affects all al atoms previously inserted within
   this loop.
2  asym
!b asym

   Shows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in
   the asymmetric unit.
2  boundary
!b boundary "hkl",h,k,l [,distance] [,{"inside"}|{"outside"}]
!b boundary "sphere",<radius> [,{"inside"}|{"outside"}]
!b boundary "cylinder",<radius>,<half-height> [,{"inside"}|{"outside"}]

   You are encouraged to use this command from within the new 
   ==> 'surface' menu.

   This commands removes all atoms that are outside a boundary surrounding
   the crystal. 
   "hkl"  The surface is defined as a plane through the Miller indices 
          <h>,<k>,<l>. The optional <distance> determines the distance 
          between 0,0,0 and the boundary surface. Without this parameter,
          the distance is automatically calculated from the user supplied
          <h>,<k>,<l> as 1./dstar(h,k,l).
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are on the same side of the plane as is the origin. 
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the other side of the plane as the origin.
   "sphere" The boundary is defined as a sphere at the origin of direct
          space. The size of the sphere is defined by its radius in Angstroem.
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are inside the sphere.
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the outside of the sphere.
   "cylinder"  The boundary is defined as a cylinder of radius <radius>
          and half-height <height>, both measures are in Angstroem. The 
          cylinder axis is always along the c-axis. The top and bottom
          planes are parallel to the (001) plane. If the a- and b-axes are
          not at 90 degrees to the c-axis, the top will be tilted 
          accordingly. If necessary, transform into an orthogonal cell
          prior to the application of the boundary command.
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are inside the sphere.
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the outside of the sphere.
2  change
!b change "object","character",<number>,{"atom"|"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}

   The 'change' command allows you to change settings and characteristics.
   So far, it has only been applied to objects.

!b change "object","character",<number>,{"atom"|"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}

   This command allows you to change the character of an extended
   object. The character of the object Number <number> will be changed
   to one of {"atom"|"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}.
2  chemistry
!b chemistry

   Enters the 'chem' sublevel. Here all kind of statistics about the
   model crystal can be obtained like relative amount of elements,
   distribution of bond-lengths, ...

   NOTE: The MC and CHEM sublevel share some variables which define
         neighbours etc. and settings made in this sublevel might be
         altered when using the other sublevel. It is always save to
         repeat settings when entering this sublevel if both levels
         are used. 

   Further information is available for commands

3  angl
!b angl { <name>|<number>|"all"},{<name>|<number>|"all" },
!b      {<name>|<number>|"all" } [,<file>]

   This command calculates the average bond angles and sigmas for the
   specified triplets of atom types for the given neighbours. The neighbour
   determination parameters are set via the commands -> 'set neig' and
   -> 'set ang'. The first atom on the 'angl' command forms the center of
   the bond angle. If an additional parameter <file> is given, all position 
   parameters of the central atom (in lattice units) are written to the
   corresponding file for possible further analysis or plotting.
3  aver
!b aver [ "one" | "ind"]

   This command allows to calculate the average structure of the current
   model crystal. The average position, the standard deviation and the
   occupancy of every site within the unit cell is given. The average
   positions and sigmas are stored in the variable array 'res'.

   Without parameters or with parameter "one", all atoms on a site are
   treated as one type and a common average position is calculated.
   With parameter "ind", the average position is calculated individually
   for different atom types that may be present on a given site.

!p Warning: This command works only correct, if the structure is given
!p          in the order created by the 'read cell' command. Appended
!p          atoms are simply ignored ! However, using the PURGE command
!p          is not recommended when using this commands !!!!
3  bang
!b bang { "all" | <name> | <number> }, 
!b      { "all" | <name> | <number> }, 
!b      { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [<filename>]

   This command calculates the bond angle distribution between the
   selected atoms (by <name>, <number> or "all"). The histogram
   is saved to the file <filename>. The number of points of the
   histogram is given by 'set bin,<ip>'. The calculation mode
   can be switched between "quick" and "exact". The mode "exact"
   calculates the bondangle for EVERY atom pair within the crystal
   whereas the mode "quick" only looks at neighbouring unit cells.
   BUT in the "quick" mode errors can occur due to using the "purge"
   command or appending atoms to the structure. 
   Allowed bondangle rang, bondlength range, calculation mode and 
   sigmas for a neighbour matching criteria are given with the 
   'set' command.
3  blen
!b blen { "all" | <name> | <number> }, 
!b      { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [<filename>]

   This command calculates the bond length distribution between the
   selected atoms (by <name>, <number> or "all"). The histogram
   is saved to the file <filename>. The number of points of the
   histogram is given by 'set bin,<ip>'. The calculation mode
   can be switched between "quick" and "exact". The mode "exact"
   calculates the bondlength for EVERY atom pair within the crystal
   whereas the mode "quick" only looks at neighbouring unit cells.
   BUT in the "quick" mode errors can occur due to using the "purge"
   command or appending atoms to the structure. 
   Allowed bondlength range, calculation mode and sigmas for a neighbour
   matching criteria are given with the 'set' command.
   The resulting distances, standard deviations and number of pairs
   of atoms are stored in the res[i] variables.
3  bval
!b bval "atom",<ia>,<radius>
!b bval "site",<nx>,<ny>,<nz>,<site>,<radius>

   This command calculates the bond valence sum for a given atom. The
   parameters are identical to those of the command -> env. The atom
   can either be specified by its index ("atom") or unit cell and 
   site number ("site"). The radius specifies the maximum distance 
   for the function to search for neighbours. The radius is given in
   Angstroems. Note that bond valence parameters are only available
   for certain pairs of atoms in a specific oxidation state. It is
   also required to use the corresponding atom names, e.g. Zr4+ rather
   than Zr in the structure file. The bond valence parameters are
   taken from a list compiled by I.D. Brown, McMaster University, Canada.
   The resulting bond valence sum is stored in variable res[1].
3  corr
!b corr "occ", { <name>|<number>}, {<name>|<number>}
!b corr "disp",{ <name>|<number>|"all"},{<name>|<number>|"all" }

   This command starts the calculation of occupational ("occ") or
   displacement ("dis") correlations within the crystal. The occ.
   correlations require the name or number of two DIFFERENT atom
   types to be given. The displacement correlation calculations
   requires atom names or "all" to use all atom types. The neighbour
   determination parameters are set via the commands -> 'set neig' and
   -> 'set vec'. The displacement directions used to calculate disp.
   correlations are set using the -> 'set dir' command.  Correlation
   values can be :

!p correlation > 0 : preferred same neighbours / displacement
!p correlation = 0 : random distribution 
!p correlation < 0 : preferred different neighbours / displacements

   The correlations are calculated according to the following 
   equations:

!p           occupational                         displacement
!p ------------------------------------------------------------------
!p           P(i,j) - theta**2                     <x(i)x(j)>
!p  c(i,j) = -----------------     c(i,j) = ------------------------
!p           theta * (1-theta)              sqrt(<x(i)**2><x(j)**2>)
!p
!p  P(i,j): pair prob. sites i,j   x(i): displacement from average pos.
!p  theta : concentration          <>  : average
!p
   The resulting correlations are stored in the variables res[<i>] 
   with <i> being the number of the corresponding definition for
   neighbouring distances or vectors. The variable res[0] contains as 
   usual the number of variables returned by the command.
3  disp
!b disp { <name>|<number>|"all"},{<name>|<number>|"all" } [,<file>]

   This command calculates the average distances and sigmas for the
   specified pairs of atom types for the given neighbours. The neighbour
   determination parameters are set via the commands -> 'set neig' and
   -> 'set vec'. If an additional parameter <file> is given, all difference
   vectors (in lattice units) are written to the corresponding file
   for possible further analysis or plotting.
3  elem
!b elem [ { "on" | "off" } ]

   Displays information about elements in the model crystal like 
   relative abundances of the elements. 'void' stands for a vacancy.
   The results (range 0..1 rather than %) are stored in the variable
   res[<i>], with <i> the number of the atomtyp. The optional parameter
   "on" or "off" controls if screen output is produced.
3  env
!b env "atom",<ia>,<radius>
!b env "site",<nx>,<ny>,<nz>,<site>,<radius>
!b env "pos", <x>,<y>,<z>,<radius>

   The command 'env' allows the user to print out all atoms within
   a distance of <radius> A around the given positions. This position
   can be given by an atom index <ia> ("atom"), a unit cell <nx>,<ny>,
   <nz> and site <site> ("site") or as absolute position <x>,<y>,<z>
   in lattice units ("pos"). The neighbour determination mode and
   possible periodic boundaries can be defined using the command 
   -> 'set mode'. The atom indices of the neighbouring atoms are 
   stored in the variable res[i]. The variable res[0] contains the
   number of neighbours that were found.
3  field
!b field {"occ" | "disp"},<a1>,<a2>,<file>,<xmin>,<xmax> [,<ymin>,<ymax>]

   This command allows the calculation of a correlation field. The
   first parameter determines the use of 'occupational' or 'displacement'
   correlations. The next two parameters specify the atoms to be used.
   They can be specified as number or name (-> corr). The next 
   parameter is the name <file> for the output graphics file that
   can be read by the plot program KUPLOT. The last parameters define
   the range in x- and y-direction. If no y-values are given, only
   a 1-dimensional field is calculated. The values of <xmin>, <xmax>,
   <ymin> and <ymax> are multiples of the neighbour vectors defined.
   
   The following example will compute the correlation field along <100> 
   up to the 20th neighbour:

!p discus/chem> set vec,1,1, 1,0,0
!p discus/chem> set neig,vec,1
!p discus/chem> field zr,void,corr.xy,0,20
3  homo
!b homo "occ",<atom>,<file>
!b homo "cor",{"occ" | "dis"},<at1>,<at2>,<file>

   This command computes the concentration or correlation distribution
   within the crystal. The sampling volumes are set using the -> 'set
   lots' command. The size of the resulting histogram can be altered
   using the command -> 'set bin'. The following two options are 
   available:

   "occ": Here the concentration distribution of the atom <atom> is
   computed. The resulting histogram is written to the file named
   <file>. 

   "cor": Here the correlation distribution for all defined neighbours
   is computed. The third parameter determines weather occupational 
   or displacement correlations are computed. The next two parameters
   specified the atom types and the last parameter the filename for
   the histogram output. Note that *all* defined neighbours will be
   written to the file. To get a specific correlation distribution 
   use a single neighbour definition.
3  mode
!b mode [ { "atom" | "mole" } ]

   This command determines whether CHEM commands operate on atoms
   or on molecules. Note that when working with molecules the atom
   names or numbers in the command descriptions have to be replaced
   with molecule types. Note that not all commands are available
   in molecule mode (e.g. 'aver', 'blen').
3  neig
!b neig <index>,<ic>

   This command determines and displays the neighbouring atoms or
   molecules around a given atom or molecule given by <index> for 
   the neighbour definition <ic> (-> 'set neig').

   The resulting atom or molecule indices of the determined neighbours
   are stored in the variable res[i] where i is the number of the
   neighbour. The variable res[0] contains the number of found
   neighbours.
3  set
!b set <subcommand>,...

   This command sets various parameters within the 'chem' section of 
   the DISCUS program. Valid <subcommands> are:

4  commands
!p "ang"     : defines the neighbors for bond angle calculations
!p "bang"    : sets range for bond angle calculations
!p "blen"    : sets range for bond length calculations
!p "bin"     : sets number of points for bond length histogram
!p "cryst"   : sets crystal dimensions (if wrong determined by read stru)
!p "lots"    : sets crystal sampling volumes for 'homo'
!p "mode"    : sets calculation mode ("quick"/"exact")
!p "neig"    : defines how correlations are calculated
!p "vec"     : defines correlation vectors
4  ang
!b set "ang",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx2>,<dy2>,<dz2>,<is3>,<dx3>,<dy3>,<dz3>

   This command is used to define the neighbors for bond angle calculations.
   To group these neighbor definitions use the ==> 'set neig' command. The
   first parameter <iv> is the number of the angle to be defined. The
   variable <is1> gives the number of the crystal site at the center of the
   angle. Variables <is2> and <is3> give the number of the crystal site at each
   end of the angle. The values of <dx*>,<dy*> and <dz*> define relative 
   position of the neighbors in the same or adjacent unit cells. Neighbours
   within one unit cell have <dx*>,<dy*> and <dz*> set to zero. If you want
   to define angles crossing the unit cell boundaries set <dx*>,<dy*> and
   <dy*> accordingly.
4  bang
!b set "bang",<min>,<max>

   This command sets the range <min> to <max> of the bond-angle to be
   calculated and binned to the histogram.
4  blen
!b set "blen",<min>,<max>

   This command sets the range <min> to <max> of the bond-length to be
   calculated and binned to the histogram.
4  bin
!b set "bin",<number>

   This command sets the number of points for the histograms created
   by 'chem'.
4  cryst
!b set "cryst",<nx>,<ny>,<nz>,<natoms>

   A bug in the current version of DISCUS sometimes causes wrong crystal-
   dimensions. This command allows to rewrite the values for the crystal-
   dimension <nx>,<ny>,<nz> and number of atoms in a unit cell <natoms>.
4  lots
!b lots "off"
!b lots {"box" | "ellipsoid"},<lx>,<ly>,<lz>,<n>,{"yes" | "no"},[<fname>]

   This command allows the definition of 'small crystal volumes' to
   be used to check the homogeneity of the crystal (-> 'homo').
   For details about the command and its parameters see the help file
   entry for -> 'four lots'. 
4  mode
!b set "mode",{"quick"|"exact"} [, {"period" | "normal"}] [,<axes>]

   This command switches the calculation mode between "quick" and "exact".
   In the "quick" mode only the neighbouring unit cells around a certain
   atom are taken into account. If the command 'purge' is performed or a
   structure is read where the atoms are not listed in the DISCUS order
   this mode might fail, because the calculation of the index of an atom
   in a neighouring unit cell can be wrong. In this case the "exact" mode
   should be used which taken ALL other atoms into account. 

   The second optional parameter determines is periodic boundaries are
   used. Note that this only works if the "quick" mode is selected and
   NO extra atoms were added to the crystal.

   Note that this setting does not affect the calculation of correlations
   defined by vectors using the 'set vec' command.
4  neig
!b set "neig",<subcommand>

   This command determines how DISCUS calculates the correlation value
   using the command 'corr'. These settings might be overwritten when
   using the MC sublevel. The following subcommands are valid:

5  commands
!p "ang"  : Defines neighbours via given angles
!p "add"  : Adds current definition to list of correlations
!p "dis"  : Defines neighbours via distance criteria
!p "dir"  : Defines directions for displacement correlation calculations
!p "rese" : Resets list of defined neighbours
!p "vec"  : Defines neighbours via given vectors
5  ang
!b set "neig","ang",<iv1> [,<iv2>,..]
!b set "neig","ang",<iv1> ,<iv2>, "range"

   "Ang" results in DISCUS using correlation angles <iv> to be used
   for the calculation. The parameters are the numbers <iv> of the 
   correlation angles defined with 'set ang'.
   If the second command form is given, the correlation angles in the
   range <iv1> to <iv2> will be used for the calculation.
5  add
!b set "neig","add"
   
   "Add" adds the current neighbour definition to the list of
   definitions executed later by the -> 'corr' command. Use 'show'
   to get a list of defined correlation vectors/distances. DISCUS saves
   actually a copy so that no "add" is needed after the last definition
   is entered.
5  dis
!b set "neig","dis",<u>,<v>,<w>,<fsig> [, <wsig>] [, {"sym" | "nosym"}]

   "Dis" causes DISCUS to determine the neighbours used for the 
   calculation of the correlations using the given distance and 
   direction (optional). Those neighbours having a distance corresponding
   to the vector <u>,<v>,<w> given in unit cell units are taken into
   account for the calculation. The parameter <fsig> sets the allowed
   difference of the observed distance to the theoretical value
   (+- <fsig>/2). The next optional parameter gives the allowed deviation 
   from the neighbouring direction given by <u>,<v>,<w>. The last 
   parameter determines if symmetrically equivalent directions to 
   <u>,<v>,<w> should be used as well. If this parameter is omitted ALL
   neighbours with the correct distance are valid.
5  dir
!b set "neig","dir",<x1>,<y1>,<z1> [,<x2>,<y2>,<z2>]
!b set "neig","dir","all"

   This command sets the displacement directions to be used for the
   calculation of displacement correlations. The parameter "all" will
   calculate the displacement correlations for displacements in all
   directions, i.e. the resulting correlation gives the correlation
   of displacements of two neighbouring atoms regardless of the direction
   of the displacement itself. One can also give specific directions,
   e.g. if one wants to determine the correlations of displacements 
   in  z-direction of site i with the ones in x direction of site j 
   one would enter the command 'set dir,0,0,1,1,0,0'. Note that the 
   neighbouring vector between sites i and j is set by the command 
   'set neig'. If <x2>,<y2>,<z2> are not given their values are set to 
   those of <x1>,<y1>,<z1>.
5  rese
!b set "neig","rese"

   "Rese" resets the list of correlation vector/distances definitions.
5  vec
!b set "neig","vec",<iv1> [,<iv2>,..]
!b set "neig","ang",<iv1> ,<iv2>, "range"

   "Vec" results in DISCUS using correlation vectors <iv> to be used
   for the calculation. The parameters are the numbers <iv> of the 
   correlation vectors defined with 'set vec'.

   If the second command form is given, the correlation vectors in the
   range <iv1> to <iv2> will be used for the calculation.
4  vec
!b set "vec",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx>,<dy>,<dz>

   This command is used to define correlation vectors that might be used
   to calculate correlations within the crystal (-> 'set neig'). The 
   first parameter <iv> is the number of the vector to be defined. The
   variables <is1> and <is2> give the number of the crystal site at each
   end of the vector. The values of <dx>,<dy> and <dz> define the vector
   in unit cells. Correlation vectors within one unit cell have <dx>,<dy>
   and <dz> set to zero. If you want to define correlation vectors crossing
   the unit cell boundaries set <dx>,<dy> and <dy> accordingly.
3  show
!b show

   This command lists the current settings and correlation vector
   definitions on the screen.
3  trans
!b trans <atomindex> or
!b trans <x>,<y>,<z>,<site>

   This command allows to transform between a given index of the
   storage array <atomindex> and the corresponding unitcell <x>,<y>,<z>
   and site <site>. The parameter not given is calculated ...

   Trans stores the results in the "res[]" variable:
   res[1] : <atomindex>
   res[2] : <x>
   res[3] : <y>
   res[4] : <z>
   res[5] : <site>

   The command is identical to the ==> 'index2cell' command in the
   main menu.
2  connectivity

   Switches to the connectivity menu.
   At this menu all parameters related to interatomic distances
   and the connectivity list are defined.

3  Commands
!p add     ! Adds a new definition 
!p create  ! Creates the actual connectivity list for each atom
!p delete  ! Deletes the connectivity list
!p remove  ! Removes an individual connectivity definition
!p reset   ! Resets to program start, removes all def.s and the connectivity list
!p set     ! Sets an individual definition
!p show    ! Shows the current definitions
3  add
!b add <central_atom_type>, <neigh types>, <rmin>, <rmax> , <def_name>

   Add a new connectivity definition. 
   For the atom type <central_atom_type> a new definition is added. Atoms
   of types <neigh types> that are in a distance shell from <rmin> to <rmax> 
   are entered into this definition. The last parameter is a name for
   this definition. 
   This command just definef the settings of this connectivity. The 
   actual list is created via ==> 'create'.
3  create

   Creates the actual connectivity list. 
   The program performs a loop over all atoms and searches for neighbors
   that are valid under any of the connectivity definitions. The valid
   neighbors are recorded into the connectivity list

   Warning, keep in mind that ==> 'property' settings will affect the
   search for neighbors as well.

   Any old connectivity list is replaced by a new 'create' command.
3  delete

   Deletes the current connectivity list.
3  remove
!b remove <central_atom_type>, {<def.no.>| <def_name>}

   Removes the definition number <def.no.> or name <def_name> for 
   central atom type <central_atom_type>.
   If further definitions exist for this atom type, they are shifted
   forward, and their definition no. is decremented.
3  reset

   Resets the connectivity to program start conditions.
   All definitions are removed and the connectivity list is deleted.
3  set
!b set <central_atom_type>, {<def.no.>| <def_name>}, <neigh types>, <rmin>, <rmax> 

   This command allows you to replace the settings for the definition 
   number <def.no.> or name <def_name> for the central atom type 
   <central_atom_type>.
   The definition must have been created by a previous 'add' command.
3  show
!b show
!b show "connectivity", <atom_no.>, <def.no.>

   Without arguments, the 'show' command shows a list of all 
   connectivity definitions that have been added.

   With the fixed first parameter "connectivity", the show command will
   show the list of neighbors around atom no. <atom_no.>, which have
   been found using definition number <def.no.> for the scattering
   type of atom no. <atom_no.>
   The list of atom numbers is coppied into the result variable "res".

2  copy
!b copy <s> , < n> , <x> , <y> , <z>

   Copies an atom. If <s> is "a" the atom number <n> is copied to
   absolute positions <x>,<y>,<z> in crystal space, if <s> is "r", a
   relative motion copies the atom number <n> to the sum of present
   position and vector <x>,<y>,<z>.
2  d2r
!b d2r <u>,<v>,<w>

   This command transforms direct space vector <uvw> into its corresponding
   reciprocal space coordinates. See "r2d" for the reverse transformation.
   The resulting vector is stored in "res[1]", "res[2]", "res[3]".

   The parallel, equivalent vector, normalized to 1/(length of [u,v,w]) 
   is stored in "res[4]", "res[5]", "res[6]"
2  define
!b define generator, {"center" | "symmetry"}

   The define commands sets a variety of parameters that are specific
   to the special program, here DISCUS. See the ==> "set" command at
   the "Command Language" help entry for information of general settings
   common to all programs within the DIFFUSE suite.

!b define generator, {"center" | "symmetry"}

   In the original progem development, all generators of a given space
   group were applied strictly in the sequence as printed in the header
   of the International Tables. Specifically, the centering generators
   were applied prior to all other generators. Each atom is immediately 
   followed by the corresponding atom to which the centering vector has
   been added.

   In R-centered space groups, a horizontal 2-fold axis, or a center of
   inversion turns the centering vector upside down, effectively 
   converting it into the other centering vector. Thus in these space
   groups, the sequence of some atoms is not exactly that as printed in
   the Tables.

   To adjust this, DISCUS now offers a new mode, in which the centering
   generators are applied after all other generators. Under this new mode,
   all atoms are in the sequence as printed in the International Tables.
   For centered space groups, this block of atom is followed by a
   corresonping block of atoms that is simply translated by the centering
   vector.

   define generator,symmetry
   turns on the sequence in which symmetry generators are applied first
   define generator,center
   turns on the sequence in which centering generators are applied first

   Currently the "center" mode is the default value, this will be changed 
   in future releases!
2  diff-four
!b diff

   Switches to the difference Fourier level of DISCUS.
   All input parameters are identical to "inverse" see the help to
   "inverse" for further details.

   The difference Fourier can only be calculated from a "shelxl" type 
   file. The program calculates (Fobs-Fcalc) and then calculates the
   corresponding inverse Fourier.
2  find
!b find "env",{"all"|{<name>|<number>} [, ...]},x,y,z,min_radius,max_radius
!b find "menv",{"all"|{<name>|<number>} [, ...]},x,y,z,min_radius,max_radius

   This command serves to find something. The first parameter defines
   what DISCUS shall find.

!b "env"
   DISCUS finds the environment around a given position. This environment 
   consists of all atoms that are closer than a given radius. 
   Only those atoms are included that fulfill the global property
   selection rules ==> 'property'.

!b "menv"
   DISCUS finds the environment around a given position. It consists
   of all molecules that are closer than the given distance.

   The last two parameters define the minimum and maximum radii of the
   shell within DISCUS will search for neighbours.
   The three parameters immediately prior to the radii define the 
   central position whose environment is to be found.
   The second to last but five parameter(s) define which of the 
   surrounding atoms are to be included in the environment. If the
   second parameter is "all" all atoms are included in the environment,
   else only those atoms specified by <name> or <number> of the 
   scattering curve.

   The number of neighbouring atoms is stored in "env[0]", the indices
   are stored in the next <env[0]> elements of "env". The resulting bond
   lengths are stored in the first <env[0]> elements of "res". "res[0]"
   is set to the same value as "env[0]". Thus,for example, it is possible 
   to search selectively for the next oxygen atoms, while ignoring all 
   other atoms.

   Examples

!p find all,0,0,0, 0.1,3.05

   Finds the environment consisting of all atoms at distances larger
   or equal to 0.1 Angstrom up to 3.05 Angstrom from the origin.

!p find env,o,n, 1.25,-5.25,3.34, 2.0,2.9

   Finds all oxygen and nitrogen atoms that are between 2.0
   and 2.9 Angstrom from position 1.25,-5.25,3.34
2  fourier
!b fourier

   This sublevel of DISCUS calculates the Fourier transform of the given 
   crystal structure. The algorithm to speed up the explicit Fourier is 
   based on the program 'diffuse' by B.D. Butler. See also: B.D. Butler & 
   T.R. Welberry, (1992).  J. Appl. Cryst. 25, 391-399.

   The program allows to calculate X-ray and neutron scattering including
   isotropic temperature factors and anomalous scattering. The program
   also allows to subtract the structure factor of the average structure
   from the calculated diffraction pattern. 

   You may calculate a single line through reciprocal space, a layer
   or a three dimensional volume.

3  abs
!b abs <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the abscissa
   is written to the output file.
3  calc
!b calc <h>,<k>,<l>
   Calculates the structure factor at a single point h,k,l.
   The real value is stored in res[1], the imaginary value in res[2].
   The corresponding value normalized to one unit cell are stored in
   res[3] and res[4], respectively. res[0] is set to 4 to indicate 
   that 4 values may be found in res.
3  delf
!b delf { <name> | <number> } , <f'> , <f''>
!b delf { <name> | <number> | "all" } , "internal"

   Defines for the element <name> or the scattering curve number <number>
   the real <f'> and the imaginary <f''> correction terms for the 
   scattering factors. 
   DISCUS calculates the effective atomic form factor as:
                   f + f' + i*f''
   This means that you should enter the value of f' as a negative number
   and f'' as a positive number.

   The correction terms are used only, if the dispersion is set to
   anomalous ==> 'disp'.

!b delf { <name> | <number> | "all" } , "internal"

   The second command form allows you to set the values back to the
   internally tabulated values. Keep in mind that these only work with 
   wavelengths specified by their name as in ==>  wvle moa1'. 
   This command just sets the flag for the element. 
   The values are actually not changed, until the anomalous dispersion 
   is set on ==> 'disp'.
3  disp
!b disp [<switch>]

   switches anomalous dispersion on /off. If <switch> is "anom" anomalous
   dispersion will be calculated, if the switch is omitted, no anomalous 
   dispersion is calculated.
3  electron
!b electron

   switches to electron calculation
3  layer
!b layer <e11,e12,e13, e21,e22,e23, e31,e32,e33, inc1,inc2>

   sets the lower left, lower right and upper left corner of the
   Fourier plane to be calculated and sets the number of data
   points along the horizontal and the vertical
3  ll
!b ll <e11> , <e12> , <e13>

   Sets the lower left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  lots
!b lots "off"
!b lots {"box" | "ellipsoid"},<lx>,<ly>,<lz>,<n>,{"yes" | "no"}

   The program allows to Fourier transform large crystals by averaging
   the scattering from smaller volumes selected at random. This allows
   to avoid very long correlations which might occur if the complete
   crystal scatters in phase. 

   If this option is not wanted and the complete crystal should be 
   transformed at once, this option can be turned off by the 
   command 'lots off'. Otherwise the following parameters must be
   specified: First the lot shape. The choices are "box" or 
   "ellipsoid". Usually the first letter of the parameter is sufficient.
   The following parameters <lx>,<ly> and <lz> describe the size of
   the subvolumes in unit cells. The parameter <n> specifies the number
   of such volumes to be averaged. The last parameter can be "yes"
   or "no" and selects if periodic boundary conditions should be
   applied.

   The lot size should be slightly larger than the longest correlations
   present in the model crystal studied. The number of lots to be
   averaged should be set to a value that complete crystal will be
   covered once on average. 

!b WARNING:
   If the command 'purge' is performed or a structure is read where the 
   atoms are not listed in the DISCUS order this command should be set
   to 'lots off'.
3  lr
!b lr <e21> , <e22> , <e23>

   Sets the lower right corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  nabs
!b nabs <inc1>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   abscissa.
3  neut
!b neut

   Switches to neutron diffraction
3  nord
!b nord <inc2>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   ordinate.
3  ntop
!b ntop <inc2>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   top axis.
3  ord
!b ord <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the ordinate
   is written to the output file.
3  run
!b run

   starts the Fourier calculation. The user is given a rough
   estimate of the time it will take.
3  scat
!b scat { <name> | <number> },<a1>,<b1>,<a2>,<b2>,<a3>,<b3>,<a4>,<b4>,<c>
!b scat { <name> | <number> | "all" }, <name>
!b scat { <name> | <number> | "all" }, "internal"

   The first command form defines for the element <name> or the scattering 
   curve number <number> a new scattering factor in the exponential form.
   The scattering factor is calculated as:
   f(h) = a(i) * e**(b(i)/4*h**2) + c(i)
   For neutron scattering lengths, set a(i) and b(i) to zero.

!b scat { <name> | <number> | "all" }, <name>

   The second form of the command allows you to set the scattering factor
   of two elements to identical values. This comes in handy when you would
   like to use elements like O1, O2 etc for different oxygen species, or 
   for dummy atom names like xxxx. The command 
   scat O1,O  
   would set the scattering factor of O1 to those values of oxygen. The 
   second parameter must be a valid atom name. See the entry "atom names"
   for a list of vaild names.

!b scat { <name> | <number> | "all" }, "internal"

   The third form finally allows you to set the scattering factor back
   to the internally tabulated values.
3  set
!b set "aver" [, <per>]
!b set {"external"|"internal"}

!b set "aver" [, <per>]

   The Fourier level of DISCUS allows to subtract the average structure
   factor <F> by setting the parameter <per> to a value not equals zero. 
   The value of <per> sets the percentage of the crystal to be used to 
   calculate <F>. 

   The average is calculated by putting <per> % of the crystals atoms 
   into a single unit cell which is Fourier transformed and multiplied 
   with the interference function of the lot shape.

!b WARNING:
   If the command 'purge' is performed or a structure is read where the 
   atoms are not listed in the DISCUS order the average structure will
   not be calculated correctly !

!b set {"external"|"internal"}

   Usually DISCUS will assume that all atoms in the crystal represent
   real atoms. In this case the internally tabulated atomic form factors
   are used to calculate the Fourier transformation. You can explicitly
   set this mode by typing "set internal".
   As of version 3.4.2 DISCUS can handle extended objects such as 
   cubes, cylinders, and spheres. Their Fourier transform is calculated
   using the approprate anayltical expression. In order to activate
   this state, you must set the Fourier to "external".
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current settings for the Fourier transform file
3  temp
!b temp <switch>

   sets whether temperature coefficients are to be used or not.
   Valid values for <switch> are "use" and "ignore". The first
   two letters of the switch are sufficient.
3  tl
!b tl <e41> , <e42> , <e43>

   Sets the top   left corner of the Fourier volume to be calculated.
3  wvle
3  top
!b top <switch>

   is written to the output file.
3  ul
!b ul <e31> , <e32> , <e33>

   Sets the upper left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  wvle
!b wvle { <name> | <value> }

   Defines the wave length to be used. Anomalous dispersion will only
   be calculated if the wave length is given as symbol.
3  xray
!b xray

   Switches to X-ray calculation
2  functions

   The following DISCUS specific functions exist. For a listing
   of general intrinsic functions see help entry 'functions' in
   the 'command language' section of the online help.

!p bang(u1,u2,u3,v1,v2,v3[,w1,w2,w3])
!p                                 ! Returns the bond angle at the site v
!p                                   If only vectors u and v are given, the

!p                                   result is stored as res[1] as well. 
!p                                   res[2] receives the position of the atom 
!p                                   within the molecule.
!p rang(h1,h2,h3,k1,k2,k3[,l1,l2,l3])
!p                                 ! Returns the angle between vectors
!p                                   k-h and k-l at reciprocal site k.
!p                                   If l is omitted, the angle between the
!p                                   reciprocal vectors h and k is returned.
!p scalpro(u1,u2,u3,v1,v2,v3 [,{"dd"|"rr"|"dr"|"rd"}])
!p                                 ! Returns the scalar product between
!p                                   the two vectors u and v. 
!p                                   Both vectors may be given in direct
!p                                   or real space coordinates, flagged 
!p                                   in parameter no 7. "d" means real space,
!p                                   "r" reciprocal space.
!p gran(val,typ)                   ! Returns Gaussian distributed pseudo
!p                                   random number with mean zero an a width

!p                                   "s" <val> is taken as sigma, if <typ>
!p                                   is "f", <val> is taken as FWHM.
!p gbox(r1,r2,r3)                  ! Returns pseudo random number with
!p                                   distribution given by a box centered

   The arguments to any of these functions are any arithmetic expression.
2  import
!b import "shelx",<file{".ins"]>
!b import "rmcprofile",<file{".cssr"]>

   This command converts other crystal structure formats into a DISCUS 
   unit cell.

3  shelx
!b "shelx",<file{".ins"]>

   If the first parameter is "shelx" the input file is assumed to be a
   SHELX "*.ins" or "*.res" file. The extension ".ins" may be omitted.
   DISCUS will read the input file and create a file <file>".cell" in
   the DISCUS cell format.
   The space group is always set to P1, since SHELX defines the individual
   symmetry operations. 
   The lattice is written into the DISCUS file as a generator.
   The SHELX symmetry operations are written as individual generator operations
   into the DISCUS file.
   The atom names are taken from the SHELX "SFAC" instruction and used for
   the individual atoms.
   Atom coordinates are properly interpreted including the use of SHELX free
   variables.

   LIMITATIONS
   The "DISP" instruction is ignored.
   Explicit form factors on the "SCAT" instruction are ignored
   ALL instructions following the "FVAR" instruction up to the "HKLF" 
   instructions are interpreted as atoms, unless they are valid SHELX 
   commands.
   The site occupation factors are ignored.
   The anisotropic atomic displacement parameters are crudely replaced
   by a very approximate isotropic U.
   Currently DISCUS does not recognize the internal symmetry of a molecule.
3  rmcprofile

   DISCUS will read a RMCProfile *.cssr file and write a corresponding
   structure file.
2  index2cell
!b index2cell <atomindex> or
!b index2cell <x>,<y>,<z>,<site>

   This command allows to switch between a given index of the
   storage array <atomindex> and the corresponding unitcell <x>,<y>,<z>
   and site <site>. The parameter not given is calculated ...

   index2cell stores the results in the "res[]" variable:
   res[1] : <atomindex>
   res[2] : <x>
   res[3] : <y>
   res[4] : <z>
   res[5] : <site>

   The command is identical to the ==> 'trans' command in the
   chemistry menu.
2  ins
!b ins <name>, <x>,<y>,<z> [,t>]

   Inserts an atom of type <name> at the position <x,y,z>
   in crystal space. Optionally the temperature coefficient may be
   given.
2  insert
!b insert {"domain"|"object"|"molecule"}

   Opens the menu to insert objects or molecules.

   Objects are special molecules, that represent extended objects.
   DISCUS treats these objects as uniformly and continuously filled 
   matter. Depending on the shape of the object, specialised 
   Fourier transformations are calculated.
   Objects consist of four pseudo atoms with special names, that
   characterise the location, shape and orientation of the object.

   Domain are special molecules as well, which are used to represent 
   a guest structure within a host.

   Further help topics are:

3  commands

!p character  ! Defines the object/domain character = cube, cylinder, sphere
!p cent       ! Defines the center of atoms within a domain
!p density    ! Defines the scattering density of the object
!p file       ! Defines the file name with the actual domain content

!p zdim       ! Gives a deformation/scaling of the domain shape

3  adp
!b adp <value>
3  character
!b character {"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}[,<atom name>]

   Defines the character of the object, which may be one of 
   {"cube"|"cylinder"|"sphere"}. Depending on the character, 
   different formulae are used to calculate the Fourier transformation.

   A "cube" object is defined by the six {100} faces and thus extends 
   along each axis from -1. to +1. Its volume is thus eight times 
   the volume of the unit cell. For a non-cubic unit cell, the 
   faces are inclined accordingly. 

   A "cylinder" object has it's cylinder axis along the [001] axis and
   extends from -1 to +1. The cross section in the x,y plane has a
   radius of 1. Thus it's volume is 2*pi*2 times the unit cell volume.
   for non cubic unit cells, the cylinder will be ellipsoidal and
   possibly oblique. The top and bottom limiting ellipsoids are 
   parallel to the two {001} faces.

   A "sphere" object has a radius of 1. and a volume of 4pi/3 times
   the unit cell. For non cubic unit cells, a general triaxial 
   ellipsoid results.

   The second, optional, parameter sets the atom type for the object.
   DISCUS will now assume that the object consists of atoms of this
   type, or at least that most of the atoms correspond to this type.
3  cent
3  density
!b density <value>

   Defines the scattering density of the objecti type. The scattering
   factor calculated for objects of this type is multiplied by this
   density. This allows to simulated objects of identical volume yet 
   different scattering density like bubbles of a denser material
   versus bubbles of empty space.
3  file
3  fuzzy
3  origin
!b origin <x>,<y>,<z>

   The center of the object is placed at the vector <x>,<y>,<z>.
   DISCUS describes this position by the coordinates of the first
   of the atoms. It's name represents the 'character' of the object
3  run

   Performs the actual insertion.
3  show

   Shows the current settings
3  type
!b type {<number>|"new"}

   Each object/molecule is assigned a type number and you may use this
   to perform the same operation on objects/molecules of identical 
   type (like ==> symetry, shear, plot).

   If <number> is given as a positive integer, the object/molecule will
   receive this number, which must correspond to an existing type.

   If "new" is given, the object/molecule will receive the next higher
   unused type number.
3  xaxis 
!b xaxis  <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines in crystal space the scaling /and/or deformation of the
   x-axis. A set of values like 2,0,0 would mean a doubling of the
   objects x-axis. 

   DISCUS does not perform a check, whether the values that you 
   entered correspond to any special deformation tensor. The 
   ==> 'shear' menu provides elegant ways to deform an object.
3  yaxis 
!b yaxis  <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines in crystal space the scaling /and/or deformation of the
   y-axis. A set of values like 2,0,0 would mean a doubling of the
   objects x-axis. 

   DISCUS does not perform a check, whether the values that you 
   entered correspond to any special deformation tensor. The 
   ==> 'shear' menu provides elegant ways to deform an object.
3  zaxis 
!b zaxis  <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines in crystal space the scaling /and/or deformation of the
   z-axis. A set of values like 2,0,0 would mean a doubling of the
   objects x-axis. 

   DISCUS does not perform a check, whether the values that you 
   entered correspond to any special deformation tensor. The 
   ==> 'shear' menu provides elegant ways to deform an object.
2  internal
!b Internal storage of the structure

   When reading a new cell, the program stores the content of each
   unit cell consecutively. The program always generates a block of
   nx * ny * nz unit cells. The innermost -fastest- loop is nx, the
   slowest nz.
2  inverse
!b inverse

   branches to the inverse Fourier transform level of DISCUS
   The inverse Fourier transform is calculated from two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part
   amplitude or phase in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       phase
!p amplitude       phase
!p real            imaginary

   The user must specify the Fourier plane that had been calculated
   and the real space plane to be calculated.

3  abs
!b abs <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the abscissa
   is written to the output file.
3  file
!b file {"a"|"b"},<filename>

   Defines the filenames needed for the inverse Fourier.

   The inverse Fourier transform is calculated from two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part
   amplitude or phase in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       
!p amplitude       
!p real            imaginary

   If the input format is 'shelxl' then one input file is sufficient.
   DISCUS assumes the input file to be a SHELXL List type 5 containing
   <h> <k> <l> <Fobs> <Fcalc> <phase angle in degree>
   The file is read as free format.
3  format
!b form {"gnu" | "stan" | "shelxl"}

   Defines the input format that will be used. 
   Valid parameters are:

!b "gnu" 
   Sets the type of the output file to gnuplot. The intensities are
   written in blocks of intensities along the abscissa, with an empty
   line separating each block. Each line of each block contains:
   index along abscissa, index along ordinate, intensity, third index.

!b "stan" 
   Sets the output to standard file format, which is used by KUPL. 
   The output file contains two initial lines and then a block for each 
   data line separated by an empty line. The first line contains the 
   number of data points along the abscissa and the ordinate, the 
   second line the minimum and maximum value of the indices in reciprocal
   space along the abscissa and ordinate respectively.

!b "shelxl" [, {"fobs" | "fcalc"}]
   Sets the input file format to SHELXL. DISCUS assumes the input file
   to be a SHLEXL List type 5 containing
   <h> <k> l> <Fobs> <Fcalc> <phase angle in degree>
   The file is read as free format. All reflections are expanded by the
   appropriate symmetry operations, including proper phase transformation.

   If the optional parameter is "fobs", the observed structure factor is
   used for the calculation, if the parameter is "fcalc", the calculated
   structure factor is used.

3  layer
!b layer <e11,e12,e13, e21,e22,e23, e31,e32,e33, inc1,inc2>

   sets the lower left, lower right and upper left corner of the
   Fourier plane to be calculated and sets the number of data
   points along the horizontal and the vertical
3  ll
!b ll <e11> , <e12> , <e13>

   Sets the lower left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  lr
!b lr <e21> , <e22> , <e23>

   Sets the lower right corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  na
!b na <inc1>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   abscissa.
3  no
!b no <inc2>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   ordinate.
3  ord

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the ordinate
   is written to the output file.
3  rhoabs
!b rhoabs <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the 
   real space abscissa is written to the output file.
3  rholayer
!b rholayer <e11,e12,e13, e21,e22,e23, e31,e32,e33, inc1,inc2>

   sets the lower left, lower right and upper left corner of the
   real space plane to be calculated and sets the number of data
   points along the horizontal and the vertical
3  rholl
!b rholl <e11> , <e12> , <e13>

   Sets the lower left corner of the real space plane to be calculated.
3  rholr

!b rhoord <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the
   real space ordinate is written to the output file.
3  rhoul
!b rhoul <e31> , <e32> , <e33>

   Sets the upper left corner of the real space plane to be calculated.
3  run
!b run

   Starts the inverse Fourier calculation.
3  scale
!b scale <scale-factor>

   Defines an overall scale factor. Together with the automatic scaling
   by 1/vol(unit cell), this scale factor serves to put the electron
   density on an absolute scale of electrons per cubic Angstrom. The
   scale factor should effectively multiply the observed F(000) such that
   it is equal to F(000) calculated for one unit cell of the average
   structure.
   
   Every time you enter "inverse" the scale factor is calculated to be
   number of atoms in crystal / number of atoms in one unit cell. If you
   use experimental data, you MUST specify the scale factor every time you 
   enter the "inverse" submenu.
3  set
!b set "accu",{"init"|"add"}
!b set "excl",{none"|<value>}
!b set "rsym",{appl"|"igno"}

   Set defines various parameters.

4  set "accu",{"init"|"add"}

   Sets the mode for the accumulation of inverse Fourier transforms.

!b "init"  
   The electron density array is initialized, i.e. set to zero.

!b "add"   
   The next inverse Fourier transform is added to the previous value.
   This way several inverse Fourier transforms will contribute to a single
   layer in direct space, which is necessary to create a inverse Fourier
   section rather than a projection onto the layer. See the manual for 
   further details.

   If you use DISCUS to calculate the input data for the inverse Fourier,
   you MUST separate the loop that calculates the Fourier from the loop
   that calculates the inverse Fourier!!! Both parts of the program use
   the same variable to store the results and by mixing the loops, the
   result will be unpredictable nonsense !

4  "excl",{"none"|<value>}

   Signals whether certain data points should be ignored.

!b "none"
   All data points are treated as normal data points, regardless of their
   value.
   This is the default at program start.

!b <value>
   Data points that are equal to <value> are excluded from the inverse Fourier
   transform. You can use this option to mask out regions of the input
   data by setting their values to <value>.
   In the companion program KUPLOT, data points of value equal to -9999. are
   treated as excluded regions.

4  set "rsym",{"appl"|"igno"}

   Determines whether the space group symmetry is applied to all reflections.
   If the second parameter is "appl", all symmetry elements are applied to
   all reflections and the phases are transformed accordingly. This allows
   you to read a set of unique reflections and calculate the inverse Fourier.
3  show
!b show

   shows the current settings for the Fourier transform file
3  type
!b type {"a"|"b"},
!b      {"intensity"|"amplitude"|"real"|"imaginary"|"phase"|"fobs"|"fcalc"}

   Defines the content of file "a" or "b".

   The inverse Fourier transform is calculated from two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part
   amplitude or phase in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       phase
!p amplitude       phase
!p real            imaginary

   If the input format is "shelxl", DISCUS reads just one file. You can
   calculate the inverse Fourier from Fobs or Fcalc data by choosing the
   appropriate file type from one of the following choices:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p amplitude
!p fobs
!p fcalc

3  ul
!b ul <e31> , <e32> , <e33>

   Sets the upper left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
2  kick
!b kick <name>, <x>,<y>,<z> ,<t>, <na>,<ne>, <delx> [,<dely> [,<delz>]]
!b kick <name>, <x>,<y>,<z> ,<t>, <na>,<ne>, -<bondlength>

   Inserts an atom of type <name> at the position <x,y,z>
   in crystal space. The temperature coefficient must be given.
   'kick' checks the position <x>,<y>,<z> with respect to all atoms 
   numbered <na> to <ne>. All atoms that are within the block <x> +- <delx>;
   <y> +- <dely>; <z> +- <delz> are removed from the structure.

   If <dely> and/or <delz> are not given, then they default to the value
   of the last <del.> given on this 'kick' command.

   Note that the <del.> are in fractional coordinates, NOT in Angstrom.

   In the alternative form, the eight's parameter is interpreted as 
   a bond distance. To distinguish the two forms, the bondlength must
   be less than zero. The new atom is inserted and all atoms within
   <bondlength> Angstrom from the position <x>,<y>,<z> are removed.

   The parameters <na> and <ne> must be in the range 1 to current 
   number of atoms in the crystal i.e. the value of variable "n[1]",
   and <na> must be less or equal to <ne>.
   The one exception is <na> = n[1]+1 and <ne> = n[1]. This allows you
   to start building e.g. a new layer within which you would like to
   optionally insert atoms without affecting the previous layer.
   Example
   i[0] = n[1]+1
   do i[1]=1,10
     insert  al,ran(0),ran(0),0.5, 1.0, i[0],n[1], -2.4
   enddo
   This loop inserts up to 10 Al atoms in the x,y range 0 to 1 at
   z=0.5 with a minimum distance of 2.4 Angstrom. Since i[0], the 
   value for <na> is initialla at n[1]+1, all previously inserted
   atoms are not affected. Since i[0] remains fixed within the loop,
   each new al atom affects all al atoms previously inserted within
   this loop.

4  angle
!b set "ang",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx1>,<dy1>,<dz1>,<is3>,<dx2>,<dy2>,<dz2>

   This command is used to define correlation angles that might be used
   to calculate correlations within the crystal (-> 'set corr'). The
   complete description is given in the CHEM section of the online
   help (-> set vec).
4  atom
!b set "atom",{ <name> | <number> }, { <name> | <number> }
!b          [,{ <name> | <number> }]

   This command allows the user to select the atoms types used for
   the MC simulation. They can either be specified by <name> (e.g. Zr)
   or <number>. Not that different MC energy definitions have different
   restrictions on the selection of the atoms. 
   The angular distortions need three angles, while the other ones
   need just two.
4  const
!b set "const",<ic>,<const> [,<fac>]

   The introduction of certain correlations depend on a given set of
   near neighbour interactions. These values are initially unknown and
   are adjusted using a feedback method (-> set feed). This command
   allows the user to set initial interaction parameters <const> for
   the corresponding interaction/correlation <ic>. The optional last
   parameter <fac> is a factor used in the feedback process and controls
   how 'fast' the interactions are changed in each feedback cycle.
4  cyc
!b set "cyc",<number>

   This command sets the number of MC moves (i.e. visited sites) to
   be executed by the 'run' command. The number <number> actually
   defines the number of 'tried' MC moves. Note that we refer to a
   MC cycle as the number of moves needed to visit every crystal site
   once on average.
4  energy
!b set "energy",{"angle" | "cocc" | "cdis" | "disp"}

   This command selects the type of MC energy to be used for the
   simulation. The MC sublevel of DISCUS currently allows to 
   introduce occupational correlations ("cocc"), displacement 
   correlations ("cdis"), distortions ("disp") and angles ("angle").
   The energy for the correlation modes is based on an Ising model
   whereas the distortions are expressed using Hookes law. The 
   angular distortions are expressed as the square of the deviation
   from the target value.
4  feed
!b set "feed",<number>

   The interaction values for the given correlation structure are
   determined by a feedback process. This command sets the number
   of moves between each feedback run. This value is also used for
   the interval of screen outputs. Note that the energy mode "disp"
   does not use the feedback mechanism and the value <number> given
   here only determines the output interval.
4  mode
!b set "mode",{ "shi[ft]" | "swc[hem]" | "swd[isp]" | "ext[ernal]" },
!b           [{ "a[ll]"   | "l[ocal]"  | "sl[ocal]" | "si[te]"     }]

   This command determines the type of MC move used for modifying
   the crystal. The settings are explained in the RMC section under
   -> set mode.
4  neig
!b set "neig","add"
!b set "neig","ang",<iv1> [,<iv2>,..]
!b set "neig","dis",<u>,<v>,<w>,<fsig> [, <wsig>] [, {"sym" | "nosym"}]
!b set "neig","dir",<x1>,<y1>,<z1> [,<x2>,<y2>,<z2>]
!b set "neig","rese"
!b set "neig","vec",<iv1> [,<iv2>,..]

   This command is used to define the neighbours used to determine the
   correlations. The subcommand 'dis' uses the distance as a criterion
   whereas 'vec' uses defined interaction vectors (-> set vec). The
   subcommand 'ang' uses an angle at a site, defined by (-> set ang). The
   subcommands 'add' and 'rese' allow the storage and reset of the 
   list of definitions. The details of these commands are given in the
   online help for the same command 'set neig' in the CHEM sublevel.
4  mole
!b set "mole",<typ1>,<typ2>

   This command allows the user to select the molecule types used for
   the MC simulation. Not that different MC energy definitions have 
   different restrictions on the selection of the molecule types. 
4  move
!b set "move",{ "all" | <name> | <number> },<sx>,<sy>,<sz>

   Sets an user defined sigma for the generates moves. The created shifts
   are Gaussian distributed. The default is a sigma of 0.2 unit cell. Note
   that the values of <sx>, <sy> and <sz> are given in unit cell units to
   speed up the MC runs. In case molecules are selected <number> specifies
   the molecule type, otherwise atoms are addressed by their <number> or
   <name>.
4  range
4  target
!b set "target",<ic>,<value>
!b set "target",<ic>,{<number> | <name> | "all"},
!b                   {<number> | <name> | "all"}, <dist>

   The first  command sets the desired correlation value <value> for 
   modes "cocc" and "cdis" for the neighbour definition <ic>.

   The second version of the command sets the desired distance 
   between the given atom types to <dist> A. This setting is used
   for mode "disp". If <disp> is set to zero the corresponding 
   atom pair is not used in the MC simulation.
4  temp
!b set "temp",<kt>

   This command sets the temperature <kt> used for the MC simulation.
   In order to be able to use the feedback procedure to determine the
   interaction energies the value of <kt> should be set to 1.0 (default).
   As a result the interaction energies will be in units of kT. If no
   feedback is used, <kT> can be set to the desired simulation temperature.
4  vec
!b set "vec",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx>,<dy>,<dz>

   This command is used to define correlation vectors that might be used
   to calculate correlations within the crystal (-> 'set corr'). The
   complete description is given in the CHEM section of the online
   help (-> set vec).
3  show
!b show

   This command lists all current settings for the MC simulation part
   of DISCUS on the screen.
2  mmc
!b mmc

   Enter "Multi Energy Monte Carlo" section of DISCUS. This sublevel
   allows to create disordered structures with given correlations and/or
   displacements using Monte-Carlo simulations. Several different 
   "energies" can be minimized simultaneously.

   See help entry 'commands' for a complete list
   of commands available in this sublevel. 

   NOTE: The MMC, MC and CHEM sublevel share some variables which define
         neighbours etc. and settings made in this sublevel might be
         altered when using the other sublevel. It is always save to
         repeat settings when entering this sublevel if both levels
         are used. 

   NOTE: Many of the commands of the MMC mode are at first sight
         similar to the corresponding MC commands. 

   The mmc menu modifies the crystal according to the moves, ==> 'set move'
   that you define. Only those atoms will take part of the 'moves' and
   be included in the energy calculations, whose properties fulfill the
   global property selection rules ==> 'property'.

   This command starts the MMC simulation for the given parameters and
   number of MMC moves.
3  set
!b set <subcommand>

   This command allows to define the wanted correlations and most other
   parameters for the MMC simulation. The help entry 'commands' contains
   a list of valid subcommands for the 'set' command. Further help can
   be found for the following subcommands:

4  commands
!p allowed : Define which atom types are part of a neighborhood
!p angle   : Definition of interaction angles
!p con     : Definitions of interaction connectivities
!p cyc     : Setting of maximum number of MMC moves
!p envir   : Definitions of interaction environments
!p feed    : Setting of display/feedback interval

!p temp    : Setting of MMC simulation temperature
!p vec     : Definition of interaction vectors
4  allowed
!b set "allowed", <is1> [,<is2]...]

   Usually mmc will automatically determine, which atom types play
   a role in the Monte-Carlo process. To do so mmc analyzes the
   ==> 'set target' command to find out which atoms are involved.

   In some cases, you might have defined a target simply as
   "set target, 1,repulsive,void,void, ..."
   Here the purpose is to define a repulsive interaction between
   voids, while all other atoms do not play a role. 
   MMC needs to know, however, whether it may shift/switch chemistry
   of voids with other atoms through the "set mode" definitions.

   To allow atoms to take part in the "set mode" modifications of
   the crystal, although they do not influence the energy of the
   crystal, you need to list these atoms on this "set allowed"
   command.
4  angle
!b set "ang",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx1>,<dy1>,<dz1>,<is3>,<dx2>,<dy2>,<dz2>

   This command is used to define correlation angles that might be used
   to calculate correlations within the crystal (-> 'set target'). The
   complete description is given in the CHEM section of the online
   help (-> set ang).
4  con
!b set "con",<iv>, {<is1>| <at_name>}, {<def.no>| <def.name>}

   This commands is used to define correlations between atoms through
   their connectivity list. See main menu 'connectivity' for further
   details. The second and third parameter allow alternative input.
   <iv>  is simply the number of the connectivity definition within mmc.
         One or several connectivity definitions can be grouped 
         to a neighborhood.

   <is1> is the atom type of the central atom around which neighbors 
         shall be searched via the connectivity list.
   <at_name> is the name of the central atom type around which
         neighbors hall be searched via the connectivity list.

   <def.no.> is the number of the definition that has been added/set
         within the connectivity menu.
   <def.name> is the name of the definition that has been added/set
         within the connectivity menu.
4  cyc
!b set "cyc",<number>

   This command sets the number of MMC moves (i.e. visited sites) to
   be executed by the 'run' command. The number <number> actually
   defines the number of 'tried' MMC moves. Note that we refer to a
   MMC cycle as the number of moves needed to visit every crystal site
   once on average.
4  disallowed
!b set "disallowed", <is1> [,<is2]...]

   Usually mmc will automatically determine, which atom types play
   a role in the Monte-Carlo process. To do so mmc analyzes the
   ==> 'set target' command to find out which atoms are involved.

   Sometimes, you might want to fix an atom to a place within the 
   crystal structure. At the same time, though you might want the
   correlations between this atom and other atoms to be taken into
   account. This is needed, for example if you want to sort atoms 
   of type A into the center of a sphere, while keeping atoms of type
   B on the outside. In this case a dummy atom of type C should be 
   fixed at the center, and negative chemical short range order
   be realized between this C atom and atoms of type A.

   To allow an atom type to participate in the moves defined 
   by ==> set move, use the set allowed command. 

   As the ==> 'set target' command allows all atoms that it finds
   to participate in a move, the 'set disallowed' command must be
   place after the last 'set target' instruction.
4  environment
!b set "env", 

4  feed
!b set "feed",<number>

   The interaction values for the given correlation structure are
   determined by a feedback process. This command sets the number
   of moves between each feedback run. This value is also used for
   the interval of screen outputs. Note that the energy mode "disp"
   does not use the feedback mechanism and the value <number> given
   here only determines the output interval.

4  limited
!b set "limited", "OFF"
!b set "limited", "atom", <nmin>, <nmax>

   Allows to limit the atom selection the interval [<nmin>:<nmax>].
   Atoms outside this interval are ignored and thus do not take part
   in the Monte Carlo process.

   The "set limit, OFF" command switched the limitation off.
4  mode
!b set "mode",<prob>,{ "shi[ft]" | "swc[hem]" | "swd[isp]" | "ext[ernal]" },
!b           [{ "a[ll]"   | "l[ocal]"  | "sl[ocal]" | "si[te]"     }
!b            , [<atom_list>] ]

   This command determines the type of MMC move used for modifying
   the crystal. You can simultaneously use any of the moves. The 
   user defined values of the probablities <prob> are internally 
   scaled to add up to one and give the probability for each type
   of move. The settings are explained in the RMC section under
   -> set mode.
   If the atom list is given, the fourth parameter that specifies the 
   site must also be present. The atom list allows you to "move" or
   "exchange" atoms, even if they are not involved in any of the 
   target energies.
4  move
!b set "move",{ "all" | <name> | <number> },<sx>,<sy>,<sz>

   Sets an user defined sigma for the generates moves. The created shifts
   are Gaussian distributed. The default is a sigma of 0.2 unit cell. Note
   that the values of <sx>, <sy> and <sz> are given in unit cell units to
   speed up the RMC runs. In case molecules are selected <number> specifies
   the molecule type, otherwise atoms are addressed by their <number> or
   <name>.
4  neig
!b set "neig","add"
!b set "neig","ang",<iv1>,{ [<iv2>,..] | <iv2>, "range" }
!b set "neig","env",<iv1>,{ [<iv2>,..] | <iv2>, "range" }
!b set "neig","rese"
!b set "neig","vec",<iv1>,{ [<iv2>,..] | <iv2>, "range" }

   This command is used to define the neighbours used to determine the
   correlations. The subcommand 'env' uses defined interaction 
   environments (-> set env). The subcommand 'vec' uses defined
   interaction vectors (-> set vec). The
   subcommand 'ang' uses an angle at a site, defined by (-> set ang). The
   subcommands 'add' and 'rese' allow the storage and reset of the 
   list of definitions. The details of these commands are given in the
   online help for the same command 'set neig' in the CHEM sublevel.

   If the last parameter is "range", and exactly two arguments 
   <iv1>,<iv2> are given, then the range of correlations from
   <iv1> to <iv2> is used.

   Examples
   set neig, vec, 1,2,8,7
   set neig, vec, 1,2,3,4,5,6
   set neig, vec, 1,6,range
4  move
!b set "move",{ "all" | <name> | <number> },<sx>,<sy>,<sz>

   Sets an user defined sigma for the generated moves. The created shifts
   are Gaussian distributed. The default is a sigma of 0.2 unit cell. Note
   that the values of <sx>, <sy> and <sz> are given in unit cell units to
   speed up the MMC runs. In case molecules are selected <number> specifies
   the molecule type, otherwise atoms are addressed by their <number> or
   <name>.

!b

   The target command sets the desired correlation values for each of
   the defined interaction neighbourhoods <ic> (-> set neigh).

   Depending on the neighbourhood type you must specify exactly one
   or several target energy types for each <ic>. The neighbourhoods 
   "vector", <cor>, and "angle" require one energy type, while the
   neighbourhood "environment" may take several different energies.
   For each interaction <ic> you may specify several targets for different 
   atom combinations.

   set "target",<ic>,"corr",     {<number> | <name> | "all"},
                                 {<number> | <name> | "all"},
                                 <correlation>, <energy>, {"CORR" | "ENER"}
   set "target",<ic>,"corr",    ({<number> | <name> | "all"}[, {<number> | <name> | "all"}...]),
                                ({<number> | <name> | "all"}[, {<number> | <name> | "all"}...]),

   A chemical short range order correlation is defined 
   between the two atom types. 
   The last keyword defines how the target shall be achieved. 
   With "CORR", you want to achieve the target <correlation>.
   DISCUS uses the feedback loop to adjust the value of the
   Ising Energy in order to achive the desired correlation.
   With "ENER", you fix the value of the Ising energy to the 
   value of <energy>. For negative <energy> values like atoms 
   will tend to be neighbors, while a positive <energy> favors
   opposite atoms next to each other.
   If you use several targets at the same time, it is necessary to 
   use the "Ener" keyword. Otherwise, the feedback mechanism will
   increase the absolute value of the Ising energy at each feedback 
   until the target <correlation> is achieved. This target will
   therefor overrule the other targets that all have fixed energy
   values.
   If you specify a positive correlation, like tom types will tend to
   cluster together, while for a negative correlation you will get 
   mostly opposite atom types as first neighbors.
 
   The second command form allows you to define correlations between 
   groups of atom types. Place each of the two sets of atom types
   in round brackets. In this case a positive correlation will 
   lead to clusters that consist of any atom of the first group to be
   neighbor to another atom of the first group and likewise at a 
   different place in teh crystal for the second group. A negative 
   correlation will give you a crystal in wich an atom of the first 
   group has an atom of the second group as neighbor.


   set "target",<ic>,"lennard",  {<number> | <name> | "all"},
                                 {<number> | <name> | "all"}, 
                                 <distance>,    <energy> [, <pr>, <pa>] 

   A Lennard Jones type potential energy is calculated for the two
   atom types. 
   The energy is calculated as:
   E = A/<r>^<pa> - <B>/<>^<pa>
   Here <r> is the interatomic distance and 
   A and B are calculated to give the minimum of the 
   Lennard-Jones potential at distance <distance> with a potential
   depth of -1.*|<energy>|

   set "target",<ic>,"repulsive",{<number> | <name> | "all"},
                                 {<number> | <name> | "all"}, 
                                 [<energy>[,<scale> [, <rmin> [, <pr>] ]]]

   A purely repulsive energy is calculated between the two atom types.
   The energy is calculated as:
   -1.*|<energy>| + ((<distance> - <rmin>)/<scale>)^<pr>
   Thus <energy> is the energy between the two atoms at infinite distance.
   As mmc compares the energy differences between two atom configurations,
   the value of this energy is not really relevant.

   For interatomic distances shorter than <rmin> the program calculates:
   -1.*|<energy>| + ((0.000001                    )^<pr>

   For a steep descent, choose a high value of the power <pr>. With a 
   high value of <pr>, the potential levels off at shorter distances 
   and energy differences become less relevant. Thus the atoms will be
   pushed apart more strongly at shorter distances, yet at longer 
   distances the influence of this potential is less critical.

   To push atoms far apart over the whole range of distances, shoose a 
   large value of <scale>.

   <energy> defaults to zero
   <scale>  defaults to 1.0
   <rmin>   defaults to zero
   <pr>     defaults to 1.0
4  temp
!b set "temp",<kt>

   This command sets the temperature <kt> used for the MMC simulation.
   In order to be able to use the feedback procedure to determine the
   interaction energies the value of <kt> should be set to 1.0 (default).
   As a result the interaction energies will be in units of kT. If no
   feedback is used, <kT> can be set to the desired simulation temperature.
4  vec
!b set "vec",<iv>,<is1>,<is2>,<dx>,<dy>,<dz>

   This command is used to define correlation vectors that might be used
   to calculate correlations within the crystal (-> 'set neig'). The 
   first parameter <iv> is the number of the vector to be defined. The
   variables <is1> and <is2> give the number of the crystal site at each
   end of the vector. The values of <dx>,<dy> and <dz> define the vector
   in unit cells. Correlation vectors within one unit cell have <dx>,<dy>
   and <dz> set to zero. If you want to define correlation vectors crossing
   the unit cell boundaries set <dx>,<dy> and <dy> accordingly.

3  format
!b form {"gnu" | "pgm" | "ppm" | "powder" [,{"dst"|"tth"|"stl"|"q"}] 
!b     | "post" | "shel" | "stan" | "hklf4" | "list5" }

   Defines the output format that will be used. 
   Valid parameters are:

!b "gnu" 
   Sets the type of the output file to gnuplot. The intensities are
   written in blocks of intensities along the abscissa, with an empty
   line separating each block. Each line of each block contains:
   index along abscissa, index along ordinate, intensity, third index.

!b "list5"
   Sets the output type to a SHELXL list 5. Each line of the output
   contains " h k l F F phase" in the format (3I4, 2F10.2,F2.2).
   The hkl are converted by an "int" command to integers. The
   user has to make sure that the increments used in the Fourier 
   resulted in integer spacing. 
   Independent of the output value set by the 'value' command, DISCUS
   always writes the amplitude and the phase angle in degrees.
   DISCUS calculates the value of F(000) and scales the data such 
   that F(000) is less than 10**8 to fit into the format. 

!b "pgm"
   Sets the type of the output to portable grey map. A bitmap of the
   intensity is written in portable grey map style. All values below the
   minimum threshold are set to this value, all values above the maximum
   threshold are set to this maximum value.

!b "ppm"
   Sets the type of the output to portable any-map. A bitmap of the
   intensity is written in portable any-map style. The color scheme
   is read from file "color.map". All values below the
   minimum threshold are set to this value, all values above the maximum
   threshold are set to this maximum value.

!b "powder"[,{"dst"|"tth"|"stl"|"q"}]
   Sets the output format to powder. You must have calculated a 
   powder diffraction pattern using the ==> 'powder' menu of DISCUS.
   DISCUS writes a two collumn output, with the intensity
   in the second collumn. The value in the first column is set by the
   optional second parameter and may be:
   "dst" : dstar = 1./d(hkl) = 2* sin(theta)/lambda
   "tth" : 2-Theta
   "stl" : sin(theta)/lambda
   "q"   : Q = 2*pi* dstar = 4*pi*sin(theta)/lambda

   For the two types of axes in the ==> 'powder' menu, "Q" and "TTH",
   you need to remember to specify limits for the axis. If you
   intend to write the output in the other format, you need to 
   specify the limits on this axis as well.

!b "post"
   Sets the type of the output to color postscript. A bitmap of the
   intensity is written in color postscript. The color scheme is read
   from file "color.map". All values below the minimum threshold
   are set to this value, all values above the maximum threshold are
   set to this maximum value.

!b "shel"
!b "hklf4"
   Both commands sets the output format to SHELX type hklf4 data. The 
   data are written in format (3I4,2F8.2). 
   The hkl are converted by an "int" command to integers. The
   user has to make sure that the increments used in the Fourier 
   resulted in integer spacing. Use the ==> 'value' "intensity" or 
   "amplitude" for the output.  DISCUS calculates the value of I(000) or
   F(000) respectively and scales the data such that I(000) is less than
   10**6 to fit into the format. The sigma is just the square root of the
   final intensity after scaling.

!b "stan" 
   Sets the output to standard file format, which is used by KUPLOT. 
   The output file contains two initial lines and then a block for each 
   data line separated by an empty line. The first line contains the 
   number of data points along the abszissa and the ordinate, the 
   second line the minimum and maximum value of the indices in reciprocal
   space along the abscissa and ordinate respectively.
3  input
!b input

   Reads an old data file
3  outfile
!b outfile <filename>

   Sets the name of the output file, to which the intensities are written.
3  run
!b run

   Starts writing the output file. Without this command the output file
   is not written!
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current settings
3  threshold
!b thresh { "high"|"low"|"sigma"|"zmin"|"zmax"} <value>

   This command sets the threshold that is used when writing BITMAP output.
   All values less than the minimum threshold are set to zero,
   all values higher than the maximum threshold are set to the
   maximum threshold. The values in between are linearly scaled from zero
   to 255.

   Depending on the first parameter, the second parameter is interpreted in
   five different ways:

!p "high"  : Sets maximum threshold for BITMAP in percent of the maximum 
!p           diffuse intensity.
!p "low"   : Sets minimum threshold for BITMAP in percent of the maximum 
!p           diffuse intensity.
!p "sigma" : Sets threshold for BITMAP to average diffuse intensity
!p           +- <value> times standard deviation of diffuse intensity.
!p "zmax"  : Sets maximum threshold for BITMAP
!p "zmin"  : Sets minimum threshold for BITMAP
3  value
!b valu {  "int"  |  "amp"  |  "pha" [,"random"]  |  "real"  |  "imag" }
!b valu { "<int>" | "<amp>" | "<pha>" [,"random"] | "<real>" | "<imag>" }

   Sets what value is written to the output file. The keyword given in
   < > corresponds to the value of the average structure factor <F> whereas
   the plain word stands for the resulting value of the Fourier transform
   which can be F or F-<F> depending on the selected modus. The command
   'value int' will save the resulting intensity whereas 'value <int>' will
   give the intensity of the average structure. The allowed values are
   summed up in the following list:

!p "int" :   intensity I(hkl)
!p "amp" :   modulus of structure factor |F(hkl)|
!p "pha" :   phase angle in degrees
!p           If the optional second parameter is given as "random",
!p           the phases for integer HKL are written as calculated.
!p           All other phases are assigned a random number between
!p           -180 and +180 degrees.
!p "real":   real part of structure factor
!p "imag":   imaginary part of structure factor

   The file name is not adapted automatically!
2  patterson
!b patterson

   branches to the Patterson  transform level of DISCUS
   The Patterson transform is calculated from two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part,
   or amplitude in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       
!p amplitude       
!p real            imaginary

   The user must specify the Fourier plane that had been calculated
   and the real space plane to be calculated.

3  abs
!b abs <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the abscissa
   is written to the output file.
3  file
!b file {"a"|"b"},<filename>

   Defines the filenames needed for the patterson.

   The Patterson transform is calculated from one or two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part,
   or amplitude in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       
!p amplitude       
!p real            imaginary

   If the input format is 'shelxl' then one input file is sufficient.
   DISCUS assumes the input file to be a SHLEXL List type 5 containing
   <h> <k> l> <Fobs> <Fcalc> <phase angle in degree>
   The file is read as free format.
3  format
!b form {"gnu" | "stan" | "shelxl" | "hklf4" }

   Defines the input format that will be used. 
   Valid parameters are:

!b "gnu" 
   Sets the type of the output file to gnuplot. The intensities are
   written in blocks of intensities along the abscissa, with an empty
   line separating each block. Each line of each block contains:
   index along abscissa, index along ordinate, intensity, third index.

!b "stan" 
   Sets the output to standard file format, which is used by KUPL. 
   The output file contains two initial lines and then a block for each 
   data line separated by an empty line. The first line contains the 
   number of data points along the abscissa and the ordinate, the 
   second line the minimum and maximum value of the indices in reciprocal
   space along the abscissa and ordinate respectively.

!b "shelxl" [, {"fobs" | "fcalc"}]
   Sets the input file format to SHELXL. DISCUS assumes the input file
   to be a SHLEXL List type 5 containing:

!p   <h> <k> l> <Fobs> <Fcalc> <phase angle in degree>

   The file is read as free format. All reflections are expanded by the
   appropriate symmetry operations, including proper phase transformation.

   If the optional parameter is "fobs", the observed structure factor is
   used for the calculation, if the parameter is "fcalc", the calculated
   structure factor is used.

!b "hklf4" [,"all"]
   Sets the input file format to the SHELX HKLF4 format. 
   Without the optional parameter, DISCUS assumes the input file to be
   a SHLEXL HKLF4 file AFTER merging symmetrically equivalent reflections
   containing:

!p   <h> <k> l> <Intensity> <sigma>

   The file is read as free format. All reflections are expanded by the
   appropriate symmetry operations, including proper phase transformation.

   If the optional parameter "all" is given, DISCUS will not expand
   the reflections by the reciprocal space symmetry operations. This is
   usefull, if you have a data set that represents all of reciprocal 
   space and has not been merged to the asymmetric unit in reciprocal space.

   If you use this option, DISCUS automatically assumes that a
   PATTERSON will be calculated.
3  layer
!b layer <e11,e12,e13, e21,e22,e23, e31,e32,e33, inc1,inc2>

   sets the lower left, lower right and upper left corner of the
   Fourier plane to be calculated and sets the number of data
   points along the horizontal and the vertical
3  ll
!b ll <e11> , <e12> , <e13>

   Sets the lower left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  lr
!b lr <e21> , <e22> , <e23>

   Sets the lower right corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  na
!b na <inc1>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   abscissa.
3  no
!b no <inc2>

   Sets the number of data points that will be calculated along the
   ordinate.
3  ord
!b ord <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the ordinate
   is written to the output file.
3  rhoabs
!b rhoabs <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the 
   real space abscissa is written to the output file.
3  rholayer
!b rholayer <e11,e12,e13, e21,e22,e23, e31,e32,e33, inc1,inc2>

   sets the lower left, lower right and upper left corner of the
   real space plane to be calculated and sets the number of data
   points along the horizontal and the vertical
3  rholl
!b rholl <e11> , <e12> , <e13>

   Sets the lower left corner of the real space plane to be calculated.
3  rholr
!b rholr <e21> , <e22> , <e23>

   Sets the lower right corner of the real space plane to be calculated.
3  rhona
!b rhona <inc1>

   real space abscissa.
3  rhono
!b rhono <inc2>

   real space ordinate.
3  rhoord
!b rhoord <switch>

   Defines which the component of the vector parallel to the
   real space ordinate is written to the output file.
3  rhoul
!b rhoul <e31> , <e32> , <e33>

   Sets the upper left corner of the real space plane to be calculated.
3  run
!b run

   Starts the Patterson calculation.
3  scale
!b scale <scale-factor>

   Defines an overall scale factor. Together with the automatic scaling
   by 1/vol(unit cell), this scale factor serves to put the electron
   density on an absolute scale of electrons per cubic Angstrom. The
   scale factor should effectively multiply the observed F(000) such that
   it is equal to F(000) calculated for one unit cell of the average
   structure.
   
   Every time you enter "patterson" the scale factor is calculated to be
   number of atoms in crystal / number of atoms in one unit cell. If you
   use experimental data, you MUST specify the scale factor every time you 
   enter the "patterson" submenu.
3  set
!b set "accu",{"init"|"add"}
!b set "excl",{"none"|<value>}
!b set "mode",{"normal"|"sharp"|"super"}
!b set "origin",{"normal"|"subtract"}
!b set "rsym",{appl"|"igno"}

   Set defines various parameters.

4  accu
!b "accu",{"init"|"add"}

   Sets the mode for the accumulation of Patterson transforms.

!b "init"  
   The electron density array is initialized, i.e. set to zero.

!b "add"   
   The next Patterson transform is added to the previous value.  This way 
   several Patterson transforms will contribute to a single layer in direct 
   space, which is necessary to create a Patterson section rather than a 
   projection onto the layer. See the manual for further details.

   If you use DISCUS to calculate the input data for the Patterson,
   you MUST separate the loop that calculates the Fourier from the loop
   that calculates the Patterson!!! Both parts of the program use
   the same variable to store the results and by mixing the loops, the
   result will be unpredictable nonsense !

4  excl
!b set "excl",{"none"|<value>}

   Signals whether certain data points should be ignored.

!b "none"
   All data points are treated as normal data points, regardless of their
   value.
   This is the default at program start.

!b <value>
   Data points that are equal to <value> are excluded from the Patterson
   transform. You can use this option to mask out regions of the input
   data by setting their values to <value>.
   In the companion program KUPLOT, data points of value equal to -9999. are
   treated as excluded regions.

4  mode
!b set "mode",{"normal"|"sharp"|"super"}

   Determines the calculation mode of the Patterson function. 
   This mode may be a:
   "normal" Patterson using |F|*|F|
   "sharp"  Patterson using |F|*|E|
   "super"-sharpened Patterson using |E|*|E|

   Currently the mode can only be used in combination with SHELX HKLF4 files.

4  origin
!b set "origin",{"normal"|"subtract"}

   Determines whether the origin peak should be subtracted from the 
   Patterson function. Since this depends on the data to be on an absolute
   scale, a Wilson plot is calculated and DISCUS puts the data on an 
   approximately absolute scale.

   Currently the origin peak can only be subtracted in combination 
   with SHELX HKLF4 files.

4  rsym
!b set "rsym",{"appl"|"igno"}

   Determines whether the space group symmetry is applied to all reflections.
   If the second parameter is "appl", all symmetry elements are applied to
   all reflections and the phases are transformed accordingly. This allows
   you to read a set of unique reflections and calculate the Patterson.
3  show
!b show

   shows the current settings for the Fourier transform file
3  type
!b type {"a"|"b"},
!b      {"intensity"|"amplitude"|"real"|"imaginary"|"phase"|"fobs"|"fcalc"}

   Defines the content of file "a" or "b".

   The Patterson transform is calculated from one or two input files.
   The two files must contain the intensity, real or imaginary part,
   or amplitude in one of the following combinations:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p intensity       
!p amplitude       
!p real            imaginary

   If the input format is "shelxl", DISCUS reads just one file. You can
   calculate the inverse Fourier from Fobs or Fcalc data by choosing the
   appropriate file type from one of the following choices:

!p file a          file b
!p -------------------------
!p amplitude
!p fobs
!p fcalc

3  stat
!b stat {"screen" | <outputfile> }

   This command calculates the normalized structure factor, and displays
   relevant statistical values like <|E**2 - 1|> for all reflections and
   several sections in reciprocal space.

   It requires the input file to be a SHELX HKLF4 file.
   The results are written to screen only or optionally into the 
   outputfiles:
   <outputfile>.ehkl   Normalized structure factors for all input reflections
   <outputfile>.statistics  Statistical values for the E
   <outputfile>.short	    Short summary of statistical values
   <outputfile>.histogramm  Number of E versus |E| for plotting 

   The input file must have been defined by ==> "file a,<infile>",
   For the statistics to be correct, the correct unit cell must have been
   defined. 
3  ul
!b ul <e31> , <e32> , <e33>

   Sets the upper left corner of the Fourier plane to be calculated.
3  wilson
!b wilson
   This command reads a HKLF4 file and calculates Wilson statistics from
   a plot of ln(average(formfactor**2)/average(intensity)) versus 
   sin(theta)/lambda.
   The scale factors: Fcalc = k   *Fobs
                      Icalc = k**2*Fobs
   and an overall B, respectively U are calculated and displayed.
   A histogram of the logarithms versus sin(Theta)/lambda is written
   to file <file>.wilson, where <file> is the base of the HKLF4 filename.

   The input file must have been defined by ==> "file a,<infile>",
   The correct radiation and wavelength must have been defined 
   within the ==> 'fourier' menu, and the structure must contain
   elements. For the Wilson statistics to be correct, the relative
   amount of atoms should be equal to or at least close to the 
   composition of the actual substance to which the data set belongs.
2  pdf
!b pdf

   This command switches to the PDF mode of DISCUS. PDF stands
   for Pair-Distribution-Function. The function actually used in
   DISCUS is the so-called reduced radial distribution function
   G(r) which is defined as 

!p   G(r) = 4 pi r ( rho(r) - rho(0) )

   The value of "rho(r)" is the probability density of finding an
   atom at the distance "r" from a given atom. Besides calculating
   G(r) from a given structure, the structure can be modified to
   match a observed G(r) via the RMC method. Note, that this sublevel
   used many RMC commands and will overwrite possible settings made
   in the RMC segment. All commands are listed in the help entry
   'commands'. Only commands unique to this level are described
   below.

3  commands
   Valid commands at this sublevel are :

!p @       ! Executes a macro (see main help)
!p =       ! Algebra (see main help)
!P calc    ! Calculates PDF for current structure
!p data    ! reads observed PDF for RMC refinement
!p dese    ! Deselects used atomtypes (see RMC level)
!p continue! Continue a stopped macro (see main help level)
!p echo    ! Echos a string, just for interactive check
!p eval    ! Evaluates an expression (see main help)
!p exit    ! Terminates the PDF sub level

!p show    ! Show current PDF settings
!p stop    ! Stops execution of a macro (see main help level)
!p system  ! Executes operating system command (see main help)
!p wait    ! Waits for user input (see main help)
3  calc
!b calc

   This command will calculate the PDF of the current structure.
   Note that the result is NOT automatically saved. This must be
   done using the command 'save' (-> save).
3  data
!b data <file>

   This command will read an observed PDF from the file <file>. 
   The file needs to be ASCII format with the following information
   on each line: r G dr w(G). Here 'r' is the distance and G the
   observed value of the reduced radial distribution function G(r).
   The value 'dr' is ignored and the last value gives the weight
   w(G) of G(r) to be used in the refinement (e.g. 1/(error of G)).
   NOTE: The data file must be in constant r steps and the first
   points MUST be equal to r=stepsize.
3  i/jdese
!b idese { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]
!b jdese { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]

   This command deselects atom types given either by <name> or <number>
   for the PDF calculation. The two commands allow one to deselect
   atom types for each atom in a pair 'ij' contributing to the PDF
   calculation.
3  i/jsele
!b isele { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]
!b jsele { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]

   This command selects atom types given either by <name> or <number>
   for the PDF calculation. All other atoms are ignored. This allows
   the calculation of differential or partial PDFs. The two commands
   allow one to select atom types for each atom in a pair 'ij'
   contributing to the PDF calculation.
3  rese
!b rese

   This command resets most PDF module settings.
3  run
!b run

   This command starts the RMC refinement to match the calculated
   PDF with the observed one. 
3  save
!b save {"pdf" | "stru" | "mark"}, <file>

   This command allows to save either the current PDF ("pdf") or
   the current structure ("stru") to the file named <file>. The
   parameter "mark" saves the distances of all pairs in <file> 
   for plotting markers below a PDF. Markers can only be saved
   if the Gaussian mode is disabled.
3  set
!b set "subcommand"

   This command allows to set most of the PDF parameters.  Some of
   the commands are explained in the RMC section (-> rmc). The following
   "subcommands" are valid:

!p "qmax"     : sets maximal Q value used for termination correction
!p "qsig"     : sets SIGMA Q for resolution correction
!p "rad"      : sets radiation used to calculate PDF
!p "range"    : sets r range for PDF calculation 
!p "rdensity" : sets rho0 correction factor manually (see "density")
!p "scal"     : sets scale factor and refinement flag (see RMC level)
!p "shape     : sets particle shape parameter for finite objects
!p "sigm"     : sets SIGMA for CHI2 calculation (see RMC level)
!p "srat"     : sets sharpening of low r peaks (Gaussian mode only)
!p "therm"    : toggles the convolution with thermal Gaussian
!p "weight"   : sets weight correction factor for finite objects
4  bound
!b set "bound","periodic" [,{"2D" | "3D"}]
!b set "bound","crystal" [,{"quick" | "exact"}]

   This command allows the user to select whether periodic boundaries
   should be applied or not. In case of "periodic" periodic boundaries
   will be applied and the optional third parameter will determine
   wheather periodic boundaries are applied in all directions ("3D")
   or only in those direction of the crystal that extends over more 
   than a single unit cell ("2D"). The default is "3D". Note that in
   case of periodic boundaries, the calculation mode is always unit
   cell requiring the proper order of atoms in memory (i.e. no purge).
   If periodic boundary conditions are used, finite spherical objects
   can still be simulated by the use of ==> "set finite,sphere,<diameter>.

   The parameter "crystal" disables periodic boundaries. In this case
   the last optional parameters selects the calculation mode. The 
   parameter "quick" will result in only neighboring unit cells being
   included again relying on the correct order of atoms in memory. The
   value "exact" will include all atoms making the calculation much
   slower, but it will work independent of the atom order, e.g. after
   a 'purge' command or with an arbitrary structure not generated by
   DISCUS. If periodic boundary conditions are not used, the background 
   line -4 pi rho r should be corrected by parameters defined by
   ==> "set finite".
4  corrlinear
!b set "corrlinear",<g>

   If the Gaussian convolution mode (-> set therm) is used, the PDF
   peak width will be modified by the term - g/r. This linear
   dynamic correlation factor <g> is specified with this command. A
   value of 0.0 will turn off this correction.

   Identical to "gamma"
4  corrquadratic
!b set "corrquadratic",<d>

   If the Gaussian convolution mode (-> set therm) is used, the PDF
   peak width will be modified by the term - d/r**2. The quadratic
   dynamic correlation factor <d> is specified with this command. A
   value of 0.0 will turn off this correction.

   Identical to "delta"
4  delta
!b set "delta",<d>

   If the Gaussian convolution mode (-> set therm) is used, the PDF
   peak width will be modified by the term - d/r**2. The quadratic
   dynamic correlation factor <d> is specified with this command. A
   value of 0.0 will turn off this correction.

   Identical to "corrquadratic"
4  density
!b set "density", [<rho0> | "auto"]
!b set "rdensity", [<rho0> | "auto"]

   This commands allows to specify a user defined number density
   <rho0>, e.g. in cases where no unit cell is defined. To use the
   number density determined by the unit cell volume, simply use
   the parameter "auto" (default). The command "rdensity" works in the 
   same way, except <rho0> is treated as a factor for the calculated
   rho0 value.
4  diameter
!b set "diameter",<diameter>

   This commands allows to specify a user defined particle 
   diameter that is used in combination with the finite size
   treatment ==>"set finite,tanh"
4  finite
!b set "finite", {"periodic"| "poly",<diameter> | "sphere",<diameter> | "tanh"}

   This commands defines how to deal with finite particles.
   Since their PDF does not contain distances beyond the diameter,
   the background line -4Pi Rho0 r must be corrected.

   "periodic"
   The program is instructed not to apply a correction. The crystal
   is periodic. Also, use ==> "set bound,periodic".

   "poly"
   A polynomial function of order N is used to correct the -4Pi Rho0 r
   line. See ==> "set poly" for the corresponding parameters.
   The -4Pi Rho0 r line is set to zero for distances longer than the 
   diameter.

   "sphere",<diameter>

   The effecto of this setting depend on the periodic boundary flag.
   If periodic boundaries are chosen, the 'periodic' g(r) is
   multiplied by the shape function of a sphere of diameter <diameter>.
   f = 1 - 3/2 r/diameter + 1/2 (r/diameter)**3
   For r > diameter g(r) is set to zero.

   If periodic boundaries are disabled, only the -4Pi Rho0 r line 
   is multiplied by the shape function of a sphere of diameter <diameter>.
   f = 1 - 3/2 r/diameter + 1/2 (r/diameter)**3
   For r > diameter the background line is set to zero.

   "tanh"
   A tanh function is used to correct the -4Pi Rho0 r line. 
   See ==> "set diameter" and "set shape" for the corresponding 
   parameters.


   The only settings that may be used if the boundaries are set to
   periodic, are "periodic" and "sphere".
4  frange
!b set "frange",<rmin>,<rmax>

   This command sets the range in "r" that will be used for the
   refinement. The range of the PDF that will be saved using the 
   command 'save' is also determined by these settings.
4  gamma
!b set "gamma",<g>

   If the Gaussian convolution mode (-> set therm) is used, the PDF
   peak width will be modified by the term - g/r. This linear
   dynamic correlation factor <g> is specified with this command. A
   value of 0.0 will turn off this correction.

   Identical to "corrlinear"
4  partial
!b set "partial","internal"
!b set "partial",<a1>,<a2>,<w>

   This command allows one to specify the weight <w> for each partial
   from atoms <a1> and <a2>. This can be used in conjuction with the
   program MIXSCAT to calculate the correctly weighted differntial 
   PDFs from a model. If the second parameter is "internal", the weights
   are calculated from the scattering lengths of the elements (default).
4  poly
!b set "poly",<p1> [,<p2>...]

   This command allows to set the parameters of a polynomial
   function that is used in combination with the finite size
   treatment ==>"set finite,poly".  The background line
   -4 pi rho r is modified by subtracting this polynomial:
   -4 pi rho r - p1*r**1 - p2*r**2 - p3*r**3 - p4*r**4 - p5*r**5
   The order of the polynomial is defined by the number of parameters
   given, which can be at most equal to five.

   Notice that the polynomial starts with the linear term and does
   not contain a term p0*r**0 !
4  qalp
!b set "qalpha",<alpha>

   PDF peaks are broadened at large values of r due to the instrument
   resolution of the measurement. This command sets the parameter
   <alp> controlling tthe broadening which has the functional form
   <alp>**2 * r**2.
   Identical to "qbroad"
4  qbroad
!b set "qbroad",<qbroad>

   PDF peaks are broadened at large values of r due to the instrument
   resolution of the measurement. This command sets the parameter
   <qbroad> controlling tthe broadening which has the functional form
   <qbroad>**2 * r**2.
   Identical to "qalpha"
4  qmax
!b set "qmax",<qmax>

   Since we can only measure the scattering up to a maximum value
   in Q, the resulting PDF will show termination ripples. In order to
   account for these, termination ripples can be calculated for the
   computed PDF. In order to do this the actual maximum Q value 
   <qmax> in A**-1 must be entered. If the value is zero NO termination
   correction will be applied.
4  qdamp
!b set "qdamp",<qdamp>

   This allows to enter a value <qdamp> for the correction of the
   limited resolution of the experiment. This results in a dampening
   of the G(r) function with increasing values of r. Again if the
   entered value is zero, no correction will be applied.
   Identical to "qsigma"
4  qsigma
!b set "qsigma",<qsig>

   This allows to enter a value <qsig> for the correction of the
   limited resolution of the experiment. This results in a dampening
   of the G(r) function with increasing values of r. Again if the
   entered value is zero, no correction will be applied.
   Identical to "qdamp"
4  rad
!b set "rad","neutron"
!b set "rad","xray" [,<qx>]
!b set "rad","electron" [,<qx>]

   This command selects the radiation used to calculate the PDF.
   The weighting factor for each atom pair is B(i)*B(j)/<B**2>.
   In case of neutrons ("neutron"), the values B(i) are simply
   the scattering length of the individual elements. For Xrays
   ("xray"), or electrons ("electron") the situation is more 
   complicated since the scattering
   power varies as a function of Q. As an approximation the 
   scattering power at a give Q value <qx> in A**-1 is used. The
   value <qx> can be taken as zero (default) in which case the
   number of electrons determines the weight. One other common
   way is to use the Q of the first peak in the diffraction pattern.
4  range
!b set "range",<rmax>,<dr>

   This command allows to set the maximum r and the step width used
   to calculate the PDF. Note that if observed data are used, these
   values are set to the corresponding values of the read date file.
   All values are entered in units of A.
4  shape
!b set "shape",<shape>

   This commands allows to specify a user defined particle 
   shape parameter that is used in combination with the finite size
   treatment ==>"set finite,tanh"
4  srat
!b set "srat",<rat>,<rcut>

   This command allows the user to sharpen PDF peaks below a value
   of r=<rcut> by a factor of <srat> (usually < 1.0). Note that this
   will effect only calculations using the Gaussian mode (-> set therm).
4  therm
!b set "therm", {"off" | "gauss"}

   This command allows the user to select between two calculation
   modes. If the parameter "gauss" is given, the contribution of each
   atom pair to the PDF is convoluted with a Gaussian. The width of
   this Gaussian is given by the individual thermal parameters B. 
   If "off" is used, the contribution is a single "delta" type function.
4  weight
!b set weight,<weight>

   Allows you to correct the weight factor used to multiply g(r) 
   before adding it to -4pi rho0 r. For infinite objects this should
   be left at the default value of one. For finite objects or in case
   of uncertainties in the chemical composition it may differ.
3  show
!b show [{"all" | "pdf" | "mode" | "atom"}]

   This command shows the various settings. If the command is entered
   without further parameters, the PDF settings are shown similar
   to the situation when the parameter is "pdf". The parameter 
   "mode" results in the output of the current RMC mode. Note that
   some settings are listed that are not used by the PDF RMC refinement.
   The parameter "atom" corresponds to the listing of parameters like
   selected atoms, sizes of moves and minimal allowed distances between
   atom types. Finally the parameter "all" will cause all settings
   to be printed on the screen.
2  plot
!b plot

   Switches to the structure plotting submenu. The structure can be 
   written in a format suitable for plotting by several structure plotting
   programs such as KUPL, GNUPLOT.

   Further help topics are:

3  commands
   Valid commands at this sub level are:

!p @       ! Executes a macro (see main help)

!p type    ! Sets type of output - crystal or unit cell projection
!p wait    ! Waits for user input (see main help)
!p vec     ! Sets a point inside plot slice
3  absc
!b abscissa <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines the abscissa of the plot.
   Instead of using the atom coordinates with respect to the crystallographic
   axes, the atoms are transformed into the system based on the abscissa,
   the ==> 'ordinate' and the normal to the plot slice ==> 'uvw', 'hkl'.
   Use these commands to plot the projection onto any plain other than the
   xy-, xz- or yz-plane.
3  asym
!b asym

   Shows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in
   the asymmetric unit.
3  bonds
!b bonds { "all" | <name> | <number> } ,{ "all" | <name> | <number> },
!b       <rmin>, <rmax>, <diameter>, { <gray> | <r>,<g>,<b>}

   Defines which bonds the plotting program XBS will draw. This 
   command does not affect the other plotting programs.
   Choose the pairs of atoms to be connected by bonds. Bonds that
   fall into the intervall <rmin> to <rmax> are plotted. The thickness
   of the bond is set to <diameter>. You can specify the bond color
   as either a gray value in the range [0 - 1] or an RGB triplet.
3  chem
!b chem

   Shows the type of all atoms present in the crystal. For each
   different atom present, its identifying number, its name and its
   temperature coefficient are listed. The list contains all the atoms
   in the asymmetric unit plus any atoms added to the structure. If
   atoms are removed from the structure, the program does not check
   whether there are any atoms of this type left. If a particular type
   of atom is completely removed from the structure, it will remain in
   the list of different atoms, and will be displayed by 'chem'.
3  col
!b col { "xyz" | "yzx" | "zxy" | "zyx" | "yxz" | "xzy" }

   Defines the sequence in which the xy and z coordinates of the atoms
   are written.
   If the 'prog' "gnuplot" is used, this will allow the user to view the
   structure from different directions.
   For "kupl" this will give projections of the structure along the last
   direction.

   If you plot the projection along a vector selected by ==> 'uvw', 'hkl'
   the interpretation of the coordinate triplets takes a different 
   meaning:
     x represents the coordinate along the ==> abscissa
     y represents the coordinate along the ==> ordinate
     z represents the coordinate along the ==> 'uvw' direction
   The coordinates are, in this case, written as:
         1.coordinate   2.coordinate   3. coordinate
   xyz   abscissa       ordinate       uvw     
   zxy   uvw            abscissa       ordinate
   yzx   ordinate       uvw            abscissa
   yxz   ordinate       abscissa       uvw     
   xzy   abscissa       uvw            ordinate
   zyx   uvw            ordinate       abscissa

   For "xyz" the plot will show the projection along uvw onto the plane
   of the abscissa and ordinate.
   For "zxy" the plot will show the projection along the ordinate onto
   the plane of the uvw-direction and the abscissa. etc.

   Since the thickness of the slice will often be limited by the 
   ==>'thick' command, the sequence 'xyz' would be the most useful one.

3  des
!b dese { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , <name> | <number> } ... ]

   Deselects the atoms.

!p "all"     All atoms are deselected, no atom will be plotted.
!p <name>    Only the atom specified by <name> is deselected.
!p <number>  Only the atom specified by the scattering type <number> is
!p           deselected.

   More than one atom can be deselected by the command.
3  ext
!b ext { "all" | "x",<xmin>,<xmax> | "y",<ymin>,<ymax> | "z",<zmin>,<zmax> }

   Sets the extend of crystal space to be plotted.

!p "all"   The whole crystal is written to the plot file.
!p "x"     The extend along the x direction is limited to (including)
!p         <xmin> and <xmax>.
!p "y"     The extend along the y direction is limited to (including)
!p         <ymin> and <ymax>.
!p "z"     The extend along the z direction is limited to (including)
!p         <zmin> and <zmax>.

   If any of the parameters "x","y","z" is used, the extend along the 
   other directions is not changed, even if previously set with the "all"
   command.
3  hkl
!b hkl <h>,<k>,<l>

   Sets the reciprocal space direction normal to the plot slice. the
   corresponding direct space direction ==> 'uvw' is calculated 
   automatically.
   If <hkl> is set to "000", all atoms are plotted, otherwise all
   atoms are written to the output file, if they are within a slice
   normal to the <hkl> (and <uvw>) direction. The thickness of the plot
   slice is defined by the ==> 'thick' command, while the ==> 'vec' command
   defines a point that represents the center of the slice.
   Further restrictions on the atoms to be included can be applied by
   the ==> 'sel' and the ==> 'exte' commands.
3  mdes
!b mdes { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command deselects all or individual molecule types used for
   the plotting output.
3  mole
!b mole { "all" | "origin" }
  
   This command allows the user to specify whether all ("all") atoms
   of a molecule should be used in the plot or only the origin 
   ("origin") of the molecule should be used.
3  msel
!b msel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command allows to select the molecule types to be used for
   the plotting output. By using 'msel' the atom selection becomes
   invalid. The parameter "all" will select ALL molecule types.
   Alternatively individual molecule types can be selected using the
   corresponding <number>. In order to use atoms again, use the 'sele'
   command.
3  ordi
!b ordinate <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines the ordinate of the plot.
   Instead of using the atom coordinates with respect to the crystallographic
   axes, the atoms are transformed into the system based on the ==> 'abscissa',
   'ordinate' and the normal to the plot slice ==> 'uvw', 'hkl'.
   Use these commands to plot the projection onto any plain other than the
   xy-, xz- or yz-plane.
3  outfile
!b outfile <filename>

   Sets the name of the output file to which the structure is written.
3  prog
!b prog { "gnuplot" | "kuplot" | "atoms" | 
!b        "xbs" | "frames" [,"append" | "init"] |
!b        "diamond" | "jmol" | "drawxtl" |
!b        "cif" }

   Selects the plotting program for which the output is to be formatted.

!p "gnuplot"  The xyz coordinates of all selected atoms are written in the
!p            sequence defined by the ==> 'col' command. 
!p "kuplot"   The xyz coordinates of all selected atoms are written in the
!p            sequence defined by the ==> 'col' command. A projection of the
!p            structure along the third direction of the 'col' parameter is
!p            plotted. The file contains the typ, color and size code set
!p            with the ==> 'set' command. Use 'load cr,<file>' to read the
!p            file with KUPLOT.
!p "atoms"    The coodinates are written in a format that can be imported
!p            in ATOMS using the 'import - free format' option. In order
!p            to trick ATOMS into displaying the complete crystal, a 
!p            new unit cell with the size of the crystal is used and the
!p            space group is set to P1.
!p "xbs"      The coordinates are written in the input format for XBS.
!p            All atoms are automaticaly transformed into cartesian
!p            space. Cartesian b axis is parallel to the crystal b axis,
!p            the cartesian c axis is parallel to the crystal c* axis,
!p            and the cartesian a axis is normal to b and c*, righthanded.
!p            The atom color are set with ==> 'set', the bonds that 
!p            will be plotted are set with ==> 'bonds'.
!p            The scale ist set automatically, the initial viewing
!p            direction is along the ==> 'uvw' or 'hkl', the 
!p            initial abszissa is along ==> 'abs'. The abszissa you 
!p            specify is projected into the plane normal to the 'uvw'
!p            direction. You do not have to worry about the angle,
!p            as long as it is not equal to zero degrees.
!p "frames"   A movie file in the format of XBS is written to the
!p            output file.
!p            Remember to change the output filename to consist of an 
!p            identical base as had been used for the main XBS output.
!p            If the optional second parameter is "init", the frame file
!p            is initialized.
!p            If the second parameter is "append", or if no
!p            second parameter is given, the current atom positions
!p            are added to the existing file. If the file does not 
!p            exist, it is created. 
!p "diamond"  The coordinates are written as the DIAMOND XYZ file type.
!p            space. Cartesian b axis is parallel to the crystal b axis,
!p            the cartesian c axis is parallel to the crystal c* axis,
!p            and the cartesian a axis is normal to b and c*, righthanded.
!p            All atoms are automaticaly transformed into cartesian
!p            space. Import the file into DIAMOND by opening the file
!p            under the 'file' menu. Use file type 'XYZ'. Display all 
!p            atoms using the "Add all Atoms" switch in the "Structure"
!p            menu.
!p            Caution, if only a partial crystal is written, the number
!p            of atoms is currently wrong. Use a "cif" format instead.
!p "jmol"     The coordinates are written as the JMOL XYZ file type.
!p            space. Cartesian b axis is parallel to the crystal b axis,
!p            the cartesian c axis is parallel to the crystal c* axis,
!p            and the cartesian a axis is normal to b and c*, righthanded.
!p            All atoms are automaticaly transformed into cartesian
!p            space. Import the file into JMOL by opening the file
!p            under the 'file' menu. Use file type 'XYZ'. Display all 
!p            atoms using the "Add all Atoms" switch in the "Structure"
!p            menu.
!p            Caution, if only a partial crystal is written, the number
!p            of atoms is currently wrong. Use a "cif" format instead.
!p "drawxtl"  The atoms are written in a format to be read by DRAWXTL.
!p "cif"      This creates a CIF file from the selected atoms. All
!p            coordinates are converted to a single unit cell.
!p
!p            Use this output format for Atoms, Diamond, or JMOL as well.
3  prop
!b prop {"ignore"|"present"|"absent"} , <property> [, <property> ...]

   Defines which properties an atom must have to be included in the plot.

   "ignore"
   The properties listed will be ignored. An atom will be included in
   the plot regardles, whether it has the properties or not, 
   "present"
   An atom must have the properties listed, to be included in the plot
   "absent"
   An atom is not allowed to have the properties listed.

   The properties can be one of:
   "all"
   Apply the rule to all properties.
   "normal"
   The rules apply if an atom is a normal atom (not a void)
   "molecule"
   The rules apply if an atom is part of a molecule
   "domain"
   The rules apply if an atom is part of a domain
   "outside"
   The rules apply if an atom is outside of the crystal. This status
   is set if the atom has been cut off by a ==> 'boundary' command.
   "external"
   The rules apply if an atom is close to an external surface, either
   on the inside or on the outside. 
   The flag is set by the ==> 'boundary' command. Individual distances
   to the boundary can be set within the ==> 'surface' menu through
   the ==> 'surface/fuzzy' command.
   "internal"
   The rules apply if an atom is close to an internal surface, either
   within the host or within the guest structure. 
   The flag is set by placing a guest structure into the crystal through
   the ==> 'domain' menu. Individual distances
   to the boundary can be set within the ==> 'domain' menu through
   the ==> 'domain/fuzzy' command.
3  run
!b run

   Starts writing of the structure. If no output filename has been provided
   or no atoms been selected, an error message is given.
3  sel
!b sel { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Defines which atoms are included in the output. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are included.
             This includes the "voids" in the structure, which are stored
             as scattering curve number zero.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are included.

   The selection made stay valid until explicitly deselected!
3  set
!b set { <name> | <number> }, <typ>,<col>,<size>
!b set { <name> | <number> }, <typ>,<r>,<g>,<b>,<size>

   This command allows to set the marker type <typ>, its color <col>
   and size <size> for the given atom or molecule. In case of atoms, 
   the input can be given by its name <name> or scattering type number 
   <number>. For molecules only <number> as the molecule type is a valid 
   input. The resulting file will contains the coordinates of the atom 
   and typ, color and size in a row. This file can be read by KUPLOT 
   using the command

!p    load cr,<file>

   The possible values for <typ> are:

!p   0 : no marker       5 : filled square    10 : line (/)
!p   1 : dot             6 : empty triangle   11 : line (\)
!p   2 : empty circle    7 : cross (x)        12 : line (-)
!p   3 : filled circle   8 : cross (+)        13 : vertical line
!p   4 : empty square    9 : line (|)              from y-axis

   The possible values for the colors <col> are:

   The allowed colour values <icol> are:

!p   1 : red       5 : yellow        9 : dark blue      13 : cyan
!p   2 : green     6 : black        10 : dark magenta   14 : dark cyan
!p   3 : blue      7 : dark red     11 : dark yellow    15 : white (!)
!p   4 : magenta   8 : dark green   12 : gray

   The size of the markers <size> is given relative to the marker
   size set in the plot program KUPLOT, i.e. a value of 1.0 will 
   result in the full marker size whereas 0.5 will reduce the size
   by 50%. 

   If you are using 'gnuplot' as program typ (-> 'prog') the settings
   will be ignored.

   If you are using the XBS program, the color can be represented 
   as an RGB triplet. If you give one value only, it is interpreted
   as gray shade in teh range [0-1].
3  show
!b show

   Shows the settings for the plotting parameters.
3  thick
!b thic <value>

   Sets the half thickness of the plot slice in Angstrom.
   All atoms are written to the output file, if they are within a slice
   of thickness 2*<value> that contains the direct space point defined
   by ==> 'vec' and is normal to the direction defined by ==> 'hkl' or 'uvw'.
   Further restrictions on the atoms to be included can be applied by
   the ==> 'sel' and the ==> 'exte' commands.
3  title
!p title <title>

   A string is read, wich is used as title for the current frame of an
   XBS ==> 'prog frame' frame series.
3  uvw
!b uvw <u>,<v>,<w>

   Sets the direct space direction normal to the plot slice. The 
   corresponding reciprocal space direction <hkl> is calculated 
   automatically.
   If <hkl> is set to "000", all atoms are plotted, otherwise all
   atoms are written to the output file, if they are within a slice
   normal to the <uvw> (and <hkl) direction. The thickness of the plot
   slice is defined by the ==> 'thick' command, while the ==> 'vec' command
   defines a point that represents the center of the slice.
   Further restrictions on the atoms to be included can be applied by
   the ==> 'sel' and the ==> 'exte' commands.
3  type
!b typ { "crystal" | "projection" }

   This command switches between to plot modes. The typ "crystal" will
   write the atom coordinates of the selected (-> 'sele') atoms on a 
   file. The type "projection" will remove the translation and all atoms
   will be projected in a single unit cell. The second type can be read
   with KUPLOT using 'load cr,<file>' or 'load de,<file>,<dx>,<dy>'.
   See the KUPLOT online help for more details on the different file
   formats.
3  vector
!b vec <v1>,<v1>,<v3>

   Sets the vector that represents the center of the plot slice.
   All atoms are written to the output file, if they are within a slice
   that is normal to the <hkl> (and <uvw>) direction and contains the 
   direct space vector <v1 ,v2, v3>. The thickness of the plot
   slice is defined by the ==> 'thick' command, while the ==> 'vec' command
   defines a point that represents the center of the slice.
   Further restrictions on the atoms to be included can be applied by
   the ==> 'sel' and the ==> 'exte' commands.
2  powder

   Switches to the powder diffraction sublevel of DISCUS. 

   Two modes are used, the Debye algorithm and a complete integration 
   of reciprocal space.

   The Debye mode is best suited for nanoparticles, as size effects
   are automatically taken into account. It becomes quite slow for 
   large crystals.

   The complete integration is best suited for large crystals, especially
   if large sections of reciprocal space are free from diffuse scattering.

3  commands
   Valid commands at this sub level are:

!p @       ! Executes a macro (see main help)
!p =       ! assigns the value to a variable (see main help)
!p asym    ! Lists the content of the asymmetric unit
!p chem    ! Lists all type of atoms present in the crystal
!p continue! Coninue a stopped macro (see main help level)
!p echo    ! Echos a string, just for interactive check (see main help)
!p exit    ! Terminates the plot sub level, returns to the main DISCUS level.
!p help    ! Gives on-line help for 'plot' (see main help)
!p electron! switches to electron calculation
!p neut    ! switches to neutron calculation
!p run     ! Starts writing of the structure
!p set     ! Sets Theta limits, grid in reciprocal space, ...
!p show    ! Shows settings for the plotting parameters
!p stop    ! Stops execution of a macro (see main help level)
!p system  ! Executes operating system command (see main help)
!p wait    ! Waits for user input (see main help)
!p xray    ! switches to electron calculation

3  electron
!b electron

   switches to electron calculation
3  neut
!b neut

   Switches to neutron diffraction.
3  run
!b run

   Starts the calculation of the powder diffraction pattern.
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current settings relevant to the calculation of a
   powder pattern.
3  set

   Sets various parameters for powder diffraction. 

4  axis
!b set axis,{"q"|"tth"}

   Defines the units of the x-axis you intend to use. 
   "q"    The units are in q=2PI h = 2pi dstar = 2pi 2 sin(theta)/lambda
   "tth"  The units are in 2Theta

   The internal calculations will use the corresponding limits and 
   increments.  Thus you need to match:
   <qmin>,   <qmax>,   <deltaq>  to a "q" axis
   <tthmin>, <tthmax>, <delatth> to a "tth" axis. 
4  back

!b set bragg, {"incl"|"excl"}

   This command applies to the full integration mode only. It 
   allows you to include (=default) the Intensities of the Bragg
   reflections or to exclude these.
   Actually rarely used these days...
4  calc
!b set calc,{"compl"|"debye"}

   Defines the calculation mode. By selecting "compl" DISCUS will
   calculate the Fourier transform on a complete reciprocal lattice
   defined by ==> 'dh', 'dk', 'dl'. Alternatively, the switch "debye"
   will tell DISCUS to calculate the powder pattern by using the 
   Debye formula. For details see the user manual.
4  delta
!b set delta,<res>

   This command allows to specify the instrument resolution <res>. The
   calculated powder pattern is convoluted with a Gaussian of the width
   of <res>. If <res> is set to zero, no convolution is carried out.

   See ==>'set profile' for a convolution by full profile function.
4  disp
!b set disp,[<switch>]

   switches anomalous dispersion on /off. If <switch> is "anom" anomalous
   dispersion will be calculated, if the switch is omitted, no anomalous 
   dispersion is calculated.

4  four
!b set four,{"four"|"stack"}

   Sets the switch for the Fourier calculation mode. 
   For all normal crystals this should be set to "four".
   If you created a crystal using the ==>'stack" menu, you can speed up
   The Fourier calculation by setting the switch to "stack". See the
   stacking fault information regarding the details of this Fourier mode.
4  lpcor
!b set lpcor, "none"
!b set lpcor, "bragg" [,<theta_mono>]
!b set lpcor, "neutron"
!b set lpcor, "synchrotron" ,<polarisation_fraction> [,<theta_mono>]

   This command defines how the powder menu of DISCUS calculates the 
   Lorentz-Polarisation correction.

   "none"
   No correction is calculated

   "bragg" [,<theta_mono>]
   Bragg-Brentano powder diffraction geometry is set. Optionally you can
   specify the monochromator angle <theta_mono>.

   "neutron"

   "synchrotron" ,<polarisation_fraction> [,<theta_mono>]
   A Debye-Scherrer geometry at a synchrotron source is defined.
   The polarisation fraction is required. 
   Optionally you can specify the monochromator angle.
4  preferred
!b set preferred, "off"
!b set preferred, {"rietveld"|"march"}
!b set preferred, {"g1"|"damping"}, <damping>
!b set preferred, {"g2"|"portion"}, <portion>
!b set preferred, {"hkl"}, <h>,<k>,<l>

   This command enables to calculate preferred orientation effects.
   Currently they can only be used if the full integration of reciprocal
   space is used, see ==> 'set calc'

   "rietveld"
   Preferred orientation effects are calulated according to the equation:
   P(h) = portion + (1-portion)*exp(damping*alpha**2)

   "march"
   Preferred orientation effects are calulated according to the 
   modified March equation:
   P(h) = portion + (1-portion)*((damping*cos(alpha))**2+sin**2(alpha)/damping)**(3/2)

   "portion" or "g1"
   is the fraction of the powder that is not affected by preferred
             orientation

   "damping" or "g2"
   is a factor that determines how close a section of reciprocal
             space has to be oriented to the preferred axis.

   "hkl"
   Defines the preferred orientation axis in reciprocal space


   alpha**2  is the square of the acute angle between the vector h and the
             preferred orientation axis hkl. alpha is measured in degrees
4  profile
!b set profile,{"off" | "gauss" | "pseudo"}
!b set profile,"eta",<eta>
!b set profile,"uvw",<u>,<v>,<w>
!b set profile,"asym",<a1>,<b1>,<a2>,<b2>
!b set profile,"width",<width>

   Defines the instrumental profile function. 

   The powder pattern is convoluted by this profile function.

   "off"
   No convolution by an instrumental profil function is performed. 
   A side effect, the parameter of ==> 'set delta' is set to zero.

   "gauss"
   A simple Gaussian function is used as profile function with 
   sigma as set by the ==> 'set delta' command. 

   "pseudo"
   A Pseudo-Voigt function defined as eta*Lorentzian + (1-eta)*Gaussian
   is used.

   "eta"
   Defines the mixing parameter ETA for the Pseudo-Voigt function

   "uvw"
   Defines the FWHM for the Pseudo-Voigt function. The FWHM is 
   calculated as FWHM = sqrt( u*tan(2theta)**2 + v*tan(2theta) + w)

   "asym"
   The Asymmetry or the Pseudo-Voigt function is calculated according 
   to the definition as in Fullprof.

   "width"
   Defines the width in multiples of the FWHM, over which the profile
   function is applied. The <width> defaults to 20*FWHM. This is a 
   reasonable compromise between cut of errors at the tail of a peak 
   and computational time.

4  scale
!b set scale,<value>

   Sets a scale factor. Thne calculated powder pattern will be 
   multiplied by this scale factor. Most useful in combination
   with the background mode ==>'set back'
4  sh
!b set sh,<shift_h>

   This command applies to the full integration mode only. 
   It sets a shift of the grid on which intensities are calculated by 
   <shift_h>.
   This will allow a substantial gain in computational spped for 
   situations in which only a part of reciprocal space has to 
   be integrated. If, for example, rods of diffuse intensity have to 
   be calculated that have a finite widh in reciprocal space in the 
   HK0 plane, then repeated calculations of the powder pattern with
   shift_h = plus/minus small values can be used to cover this finit
   width, while dh can be set to 1.0
4  sk
!b set sk,<shift_k>

   This command applies to the full integration mode only. 
   It sets a shift of the grid on which intensities are calculated by 
   <shift_k>.

   See ==> 'set sh' for further info.
4  sl
!b set sl,<shift_l>

   This command applies to the full integration mode only. 
   It sets a shift of the grid on which intensities are calculated by 
   <shift_l>.

   See ==> 'set sh' for further info.
4  stepr
!b set stepr,<value>

   This command applies to the Debye mode only. 
   The interatomic distances are binned to a histogram with stepwidt
   <value>. This defaults to 0.01 Angstroem at program start.
   As the histogram arry is of fixed size, this limits the maximum
   distance that debye can handle. See ==> 'show config' at the main
   DISCUS level for the Debye histogram size. The maximum interatomic
   distance is then 
   Histogram size * stepr 
4  qmin
!b set qmin,<value>

   Sets the lower limit for q.
   This must be set, if you intend to use the "Q" axis. 
   You also need to set a 2Theta-range if you want to write the output
   on a 2Theta scale.
4  qmax
!b set qmax,<value>

   Sets the upper limit for q. The powder pattern is calculated
   up to this q value.
   This must be set, if you intend to use the "Q" axis. 
   You also need to set a 2Theta-range if you want to write the output
   on a 2Theta scale.
4  tthmin
!b set tthmin,<value>

   Sets the lower limit for 2-Theta.
   This must be set, if you intend to use the "2Theta" axis. 
   You also need to set a Q-range if you want to write the output
   on a 2Theta scale.
4  tthmax
!b set tthmax,<value>

   Sets the upper limit for 2-Theta. The powder pattern is calculated
   up to this 2-Theta value.
   This must be set, if you intend to use the "2Theta" axis. 
   You also need to set a Q-range if you want to write the output
   on a 2Theta scale.
4  temp
!b set temp,<switch>

   sets whether temperature coefficients are to be used or not.
   Valid values for <switch> are "use" and "ignore". The first
   two letters of the switch are sufficient.
4  wvle
!b set wvle,{ <name> | <value> }

   Defines the wave length to be used. Anomalous dispersion will only
   be calculated if the wave length is given as symbol.
3  xray
!b xray

   Switches to X-ray calculation.
2  project
!b project <u1>,<v1>,<w1>,<u2>,<v2>,<w2> [ ,<flag> ]

   This command calculates the projection of vector <uvw 1> onto the second
   vector <uvw 2> and the projection of the first vector onto the plane normal
   to the second vector.
   The <flag> is a string of four characters that indicates whether the input
   vectors or the output vectors are given in direct or reciprocal space 
   coordinates. 

!p The four characters correspond to:

!p     first input vector,
!p     second input vector,
!p     projection of vector 1 onto vector 2,
!p     projection of vector 1 onto the plane normal to vector 2.

!p "drdd" means: vector one is given in direct space coordinates, vector 2
!p               is in reciprocal space coordinates (hkl) and the two 
!p               projections are to be given in direct space coordinates.

!p Any combination of "d" and "r" is allowed.

!p The two output vectors are stored in the result variable:

!p "res[1]","res[2]","res[3]" projection of vector 1 onto vector 2
!p "res[4]","res[5]","res[6]" projection of vector 1 onto plane normal to
!p                            vector 2
!p "res[7]"                   angle between vector 1 and vector 2
2  property
!b property

   Switches to the property menu of DISCUS.
   Here you can perform operations related to the properties of
   atoms. Such properties can be:
   N = normal,   the atom is a normal atom (instead of a void)
   M = molecule, the atom is part of a molecule
   D = domain,   the atom is part of a domain
   O = outside,  the atom is outside of the crystal
   E = external, the atom is close to an external surface
   I = internal, the atom is close to an internal surface

   The atom properties are set at:
   reading a unit cell or structure file
   inserting a domain into a crystal
   creating an external surface 

   The atom properties are used when atoms are selected.
   The global property selection rules apply to commands:
       'replace', 'mmc', 'find env'
       The respective operations for these commands are carried out only
       if the selected atom fulfils the property selection criteria.

   Local property selection rules are used in the menues:
       'plot', 
       To apply these, use the local 'property' command within the menu.
       The local property selection criteria are valid within the menu
       only.

   Further help topics are:
3  commands
!p property  ! Define how command like replace, remove use the property
!p set/clear ! Set or clear flag for atoms
!p show      ! Show current property related settings
3  prop
!b prop {"ignore"|"present"|"absent"} , <property> [, <property> ...]

   Defines which properties an atom must have to be included in 
   commands ==> 'remove' ; 'replace'

   "ignore"
            The properties listed will be ignored. An atom will be included in
            the plot regardles, whether it has the properties or not, 
   "present"
            An atom must have the properties listed, to be included in the plot
   "absent"
            An atom is not allowed to have the properties listed.

   The properties can be one of:

            is set if the atom has been cut off by a ==> 'boundary' command.
   "external"
            The rules apply if an atom is close to an external surface, either
            on the inside or on the outside. 
            The flag is set by the ==> 'boundary' command. Individual
            distances to the boundary can be set within the ==> 'surface' menu
            through the ==> 'surface/fuzzy' command.
   "internal"
            The rules apply if an atom is close to an internal surface, either
            within the host or within the guest structure. 
            The flag is set by placing a guest structure into the crystal
            through the ==> 'domain' menu. Individual distances to the
            boundary can be set within the ==> 'domain' menu through
            the ==> 'domain/fuzzy' command.
2  set/clear
!b set   <flag>, "types",  {"all" | <iscat> [, <iscat...]}

!b clear <flag>, "types",  {"all" | <iscat> [, <iscat...]}
!b clear <flag>, "atoms"}, {"all" | <start>,<end>}

   Set or clear the property bit for atoms of selcted type or 
   for a range of atom numbers.

   The flag can be any of "domain", "outside", "external", "internal"
2  purge
!b purge

   deletes all vacancies in the structure array, thus speeds up Fourier
   calculation.
   Due to internal calls, the result variables are changed!
2  r2d
!b r2d <h>,<k>,<l>

   This command transforms reciprocal space vector <hkl> into its corresponding
   coordinates in direct space. See "r2d" for the reverse transformation.

   The resulting vector is stored in "res[1]", "res[2]", "res[3]".

   The parallel, equivalent vector, normalized to 1/(length of [h,k,l]) 
   is stored in "res[4]", "res[5]", "res[6]"
2  read
!b read

   Branches to reading level of DISCUS. At this level a new unit cell
   or structure may be read. The old structure is lost ! If necessary
   save it with the --> "save" command.

   Further help topics are:

3  commands
   Valid commands at this level:

!p @       ! Execute a macro file (see main help)
!p cell    ! reads a unit cell from file
!p lcell   ! reads a unit cell from file (large cells)
!p echo    ! Echo a string (see main help)
!p exit    ! Exits read sublevel

!p help    ! help to read (see main help)
!p stru    ! reads a file containing a whole crystal
!p wait    ! waits for user input (see main help)
3  cell
!b cell <name> [,<nx> [,<ny> [,<nz>]]]

   Reads the contents of a single asymmetric unit from file <name> and
   then generates the unit cell.
   Optionally the number of unit cells along x,y,z can be given to
   generated the whole crystal. The number of unit cells default to 1.
   The unit cells are arranged symmetrically around the origin, .i.e.
   from -nx/2 to +nx/2 etc.
   After the unit cell has been read the program returns to the main
   DISCUS level.
3  lcell
!b lcell <name> [,<nx> [,<ny> [,<nz>]]]

   This command is similar to -> cell, however in contrast to 'cell'
   only those atoms are treated as new atom type that have a different
   name or B value. This allows one to read large asymmetric units
   (e.g. from a protein) without creating that many different atom types.
3  free
!b free [<a>,<b>,<c>,<alpha>,<beta>,<gamma>]

   No structure is read. The space group is set to "P1". The lattice
   constants are set to the optional values on the command line. 
   Default values are 1,1,1 Angstrom and  90,90,90 degrees.
   The structure does not contain any atoms.
3  stru
!b stru <name>

   reads a whole structure from file <name>.
   The space group information is ignored, nor is a check for consistency
   of space group and lattice constants performed.
2  remove
!b remove <start> [, <end> ]
!b remove <start> [, <end> ] , "mole" [ ,"type", <t_start> [, <t_end>]]

   The parameters <start> and <t_start> can take one of the following values:
        { <start> | "all" | "last" }

   Removes atom(s) number <start> to <end> from the structure.

   If you use the keyword "all", all atoms are removed.
   If you use the keyword "last", only the last atom is removed.

   Internally, this command only sets the scattering type of these atom(s)
   to zero. Otherwise the atom(s) is treated as if present. Specifically,
   in the array containing the structure the sequence of atoms is not
   changed.
   For this command variation, the atoms are removed, no
   matter what their individual properties are and whether they fulfill
   the global property selection rules ==> 'property'. 
   For all atoms that are removed, the property NORMAL is turned off.

   The second form of the command removes atoms that are part of the 
   molecule(s) <start> through <end>.
   Optionally you can specify which molecule type will be removed. Only
   those molecules of a type in the range <t_start> through <t_end> will 
   be removed. The default for this option is all type of molecules.

   If you use the keyword "all", all molecule types are removed.
   If you use the keyword "last", only the last molecule type is removed.

   For all atoms that are removed, the property NORMAL is turned off.
2  replace
!b replace <index>,<at> [,<dbw>]
!b replace <at1>,<at2>,{ "all" | <site> },<prob>
!b replace <mo1>,<mo2>,"mol"
!b replace <mtyp>,<mol>,"mol",<prob>

   This command allows to replace atoms and molecules. The first two 
   variations operate on atoms. The first variation replaces the 
   atom at index <index> with atom name (or number) <at>. It the atom
   typ does not already exist in the crystal, the temperature factor
   <dbw> has to be given as additional parameter. 
   For this command variation, the atom no. <index> is replaced, no
   matter what its individual properties are and whether it fulfills
   the global property selection rules ==> 'property'

   Alternatively the
   atom type <at1> can be replaced by <at2> within the complete crystal
   with a probability of <prob>. This works much (!!) faster than 
   replacing using DISCUS loops. The third parameter specifies if 
   all "all" occurring atoms of type <at1> might be replaced or just 
   those on the given site <site>.
   For this replacement by probabilities, only those atoms are included
   that fulfill the global property selection rules ==> 'property'.

   For both variations, if the atom is replaced by a void, the 
   the property NORMAL is turned off, if a void is replaced by another
   atom type the property NORMAL is turned on.

   The last two variations of the 'replace' command operate on 
   molecules. The third variant replaces molecule <mo1> by <mo2>. The
   positions are exchanged relative to the origin of the molecule
   (atom 1) and both molecules MUST have the same length. The last
   variation works the same way, just all molecules of type <mtyp>
   will be replaced with molecule <mol> with the given probability 
   of <prob>.
2  rmc
!b rmc

   Enter "reverse Monte Carlo" section of discus. This part of the 
   program allows to "fit" a model atom configuration to measured
   diffuse scattering data. The difference between calculated scattering
   and observed scattering is minimized. Moves minimizing this difference
   are always accepted, other moved only with a probability of exp (-diff**2).

3  data
!b data {"x-ray"|"neutron"},{<name>|<value>},<file>,<wic>,
!b      <e11>,<e12>,<e13>,<e21>,<e22>,<e23>,<e31>,<e32>,<e33>

   This command reads the experimental data stored in <file>. The parameter
   "x-ray" / "neutron" selects what kind of scattering data are stored
   in the file. The second parameter is the wavelength which can be given
   as <name> (like cua1 ..) or as value (line 1.23). After the filename
   <file> the weighting scheme to be used can be specified. The parameter
   <wic> can take the following values:

!p   "one"  : w(Int) = 1.0                "squa" : w(Int) = Int**2
!p   "sqrt" : w(Int) = SQRT(Int)          "inv"  : w(Int) = 1/Int
!p   "log"  : w(Int) = LOG(Int)           "isq"  : w(Int) = 1/SQRT(Int)
!p   "lin"  : w(Int) = Int

   All other values for <wic> are taken as the name of a file containing
   the weights. This file and the data file have to be the same type !
   Finally the three corners of the input data plane are given in the
   following order:

!p   <e11>,<e12>,<e13> : hkl's of the lower left corner
!p   <e21>,<e22>,<e23> : hkl's of the lower right corner
!p   <e31>,<e32>,<e33> : hkl's of the upper left corner

   The format of the input file is set by the 'set data' command. For more
   information about the supported data file formats see help for the
   'set data' command.

   By repeating the data command you can read several planes with exp.
   data for the RMC fit. To start again use the 'rese' command.
3  dese
!b dese { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]

   This command deselects atomtypes given either by <name> or <number> 
   for the RMC moves, i.e. 'dese' those atomtypes which should not be
   moved or switched.
3  msel
!b msel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command allows to select the molecule types to be used for
   the RMC refinement. By using 'msel' the atom selection becomes
   invalid. The parameter "all" will select ALL molecule types. 
   Alternatively individual molecule types can be selected using the
   corresponding <number>. In order to use atoms again, use the 'sele'
   command.
3  mdes
!b mdes { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command deselects all or individual molecule types used in
   the RMC refinement.
3  rese
!b rese

   This command resets the RMC parameters. In this version only the
   'plane counter' is reset and the 'data' command will start reading
   plane 1 again.
3  run
!b run

   Start the RMC fit. After the run is finished, the following values
   are stored in the res[i] variables:

!p res[1] : last value of CHI2
!p res[2] : number of tried moves
!p res[3] : number of accepted 'good' moves
!p res[4] : number of accepted 'bad' moves
!p res[5] : DELTA CHI2 average during the last run
!p res[6] : DELTA CHI2 standard deviation during the last run
!p res[7] : DELTA CHI2 maximum value during the last run
!p res[8] : elapsed time / cycle in seconds
3  save
!b save <subcommand>

   This command is for saving the calculated intensities or the 
   resulting structure. Valid subcommands are:

4  lots
!b save "lots",<name>

   This command saves the current set of lot origins to the file
   named <name>. These lot origins can be used as default in subsequent
   refinement rather than creating a new set of random lots
   (-> 'set lots,..').
4  stru
!b save "stru",<name>

   This command saves the current structure to the file named <name>.
   The format is identical to the unit cell or structure file. Each
   atom is written in format A4,3(2X,F11.6),5X,F6.4. The filename
   can be created by an format string and one or more numbers -> filenames.
4  scat
!b save "scat",<plane>,<name>

   save "scat" saves the current computed intensities of plane <plane> in
   the following format: h,k,l,skal*(a**2+b**2)+back (= intensity).
4  sym
!b save "sym",<plane>,<sym>,<name>

   Does the same as 'save scat,..', but the user can save also the resulting
   intensities of symmetric equivalent planes  by giving the number of the
   sym.-transformation (1=data corresponding to input data).
3  sele
!b sele { "all" | <name> | <number> }, [ ... ]

   This command selects atomtypes given either by <name> or <number> 
   for the RMC moves, i.e. 'sele' those atomtypes which should be
   moved or switched during the RMC cycles.
3  set
!b set "subcommand"

   This command allows to set most of the RMC parameters. The following
   "subcommands" are valid:

4  commands
   Valid subcommands are:

!p "aver"     : sets the portion of the crystal to be used for <F> calc.
!p "back"     : controls if background is calculated during RMC cycles
!p "const"    : sets possible constrains for scaling factor/background
!p "cycl"     : sets number of RMC cycles to be calculated
!p "data"     : sets data type of input/output diffuse scattering files
!p "dbw"      : ignore/use temperature factor
!p "disp"     : sets output interval
!p "log"      : controls if "rmc.log" will be created during calculation
!p "mdis"     : sets minimal allowed distances between atoms
!p "mode"     : sets RMC mode (relaxation/switch atoms)
!p "move"     : sets sigma for generated RMC shifts
!p "range"    : sets Q-range of data used for RMC refinement
!p "scal"     : controls if scaling factor is calculated during RMC cycles
!p "sigm"     : sets SIGMA for CHI2 calculation
!p "sym"      : controls if symmetric equivalent planes of input data should
!p              be used for RMC calculations.
4  aver
!b set "aver",<per>

   This command sets the portion of the crystal, that should be used to
   calculate <F>. The variable <per> is given in %. The average structure
   factor <F> is calculated and subtracted from the overall structure
   factor calculated at the beginning of the RMC refinement. Starting
   from these values the contributions of the changes atoms during the
   RMC cycles are calculated and the structure factor adjusted. There
   is no check weather <F> changes significantly during the refinement.

   To switch the use of <F> off, just set the value of <per> to zero.
   After setting the value of <per> the structure factor will be recalculated.
   This can also be used to recalculate the Fourier transform and
   the average from time to time during the RMC refinement if the
   average structure is changing.
4  back
!b set "back",{"on"|"off"},[<value>], [<plane>]

   This command controls if a background parameter should be calculated and
   used for the RMC fits. If the calculation of the background parameter
   is switched off its value can be set to <value> otherwise the default
   is 0. The second optional parameter allows to specify the plane the
   current value of <value> is set for. If the parameter <plane> is omitted,
   the value of <value> is set for ALL experimental data planes.
4  const
!b set "const",<p1>,<p2>

   This command allows to constrain the scaling factor and background
   parameter of the two input data planes number <p1> and <p2>. If 
   <p1> and <p2> are equal, no constrain is set, and the planes have
   their individual scaling factor/background. If two planes should have
   the same values for scaling factor/background, the constrain is set
   by <p1> not equal <p2>. The value of <p1> is the plane which should
   take the values for scaling factor/background of plane <p2>. Not,
   that the value of <p1> has to be smaller than <p2>. 

   If for example scaling factor/background for plane 2 should be the 
   same as for plane 1, use the command 'set const,2,1'. If there are
   more than two planes to constrain use the command several times.
   Plane 1 to 3 can be constrained by 'set const,2,1' and 'set const,3,2'.
   to unconstrain the planes again type 'set const 1,1', 'set const,2,2'
   and 'set const,3,3'.
4  cycl
!b set "cycl",<icyc>

   This command sets the number of RMC moves to be done after the 
   'run' command. Note that the number given is the actual number of
   RMC moves to be tried and *NOT* the number of RMC cycles, which
   is normally defined as the number of moves necessary to visit
   every crystal site once on average.
4  data
!b set "data",{ "nipl" | "pgm" }

   This commands sets the data type of the experimental data files used
   as input for RMC and the corresponding output files. There are currently
   two file formats supported:

!p "nipl" : An ASCII file containing the Z-values in the following format: 
!p
!p          nx ny                  ! # pixels in x- and y direction
!p          xmin xmax ymin ymax    ! dimensions in x- and y-direction (ignored)
!p          data                   ! ny rows of nx intensity values

!p "pgm"  : PGM file (pbmplus package). In the current version, only
!p          ASCII PGM files are supported. To convert the binary files
!p          into the ASCII PGM version, use the 'pnmnoraw' program,
!p          which is part of the 'pbmplus' package.
4  disp
!b set "disp",<id>

   This command sets the update interval of the output. 
4  dbw
!b set "dbw",{"on"|"off"} [,<plane>,...]

   This command controls whether the Debye-Waller factor is ignored or
   used when the scattering amplitude is calculated. If no parameter
   <plane> is given, the setting affects ALL read data planes.
4  log
!b set "log",{"on"|"off"}

   This command controls if in the RMC main loop the screen output should
   also be logged to the file "rmc.log". This file contains only the last
   output and should give the possibility to watch the programs progress
   because cached output redirection might not update often enough.
4  lots
!b lots "off"
!b lots {"box" | "ellipsoid"},<lx>,<ly>,<lz>,<n>,{"yes" | "no"},[<fname>]

   This command allows to use the 'lot' option during the RMC refinement.
   For details about the command and its parameters see the help file
   entry for 'four lots'. 

   The optional last parameter is a filename for a file containing a
   predefined set of lot origins. This file can be created using
   'save lots,..' after a RMC refinement was carried out. If no
   filename <fname> is given, DISCUS creates a new random set of
   lots for the RMC fit.

   The advantage of using lots is the combination of a smooth calculated
   diffraction pattern as average of the Fourier transform of small 
   crystal volumes (lots). This forces RMC on a 'local' scale in real
   space without the problem of large errors and noisy patterns as for
   small crystal sizes.

   It is important to subtract the average structure factor (-> set aver)
   when using this mode even if "periodic boundary conditions" are
   fulfilled, because the Fourier transform of the lots shape needs to
   be subtracted as well as <F>. This can be done using the command
   'set aver ..'.
4  mdis
!b set "mdis",{ "all" | <name> | <number> },
!b            { "all" | <name> | <number> },<dist>

   This command sets the minimal allowed distance between two atom types
   to the value of <dist> A. A generated move will only be accepted
   if the moved atom is not closer than <dist> to the others. The 
   atomtypes to be selected can be specified by either name or number or
   all atomtypes can be selected by typing "all".
4  mode
!b set "mode",{ "shi[ft]" | "swc[hem]" | "swd[isp]" | "ext[ernal]" },
!b           [{ "a[ll]"   | "l[ocal]"  | "sl[ocal]" | "si[te]"     }]

   This command allows to select one of the three RMC operation modes:

!p "shift"    : The selected atoms are displaced by a random move. The
!p              max. size of a move can be specified via "set move .."
!p              command.
!p "swchem"   : Here two atoms are selected at random and their chemistry
!p              is switched (if the atoms are selected via "sel" command).
!p              If your structure consists of only ONE atom type this mode
!p              will just waste computer time :-)
!p "swdisp"   : Here the displacement from the average structure of two
!p              selected atoms of the SAME type are switched. The mode
!p              can only properly work, if there are initial displacements
!p              generated e.g. by the "therm" command.
!p "external" : The modification of the structure for each RMC move is done
!p              using an user supplied external subroutine. Check the
!p              source file 'extrmc.f' for details how to supply such a
!p              subroutine.

   The second optional parameter specifies if the pair of the atoms to
   be selected for the SWCHEM and SWDISP mode should be restricted in
   any way. The following settings are valid, the setting "all" is the
   default, which will be taken if no second parameter is entered.

!p "all"      : Any atom within the crystal can be chosen as second atom.
!p "local"    : Only atoms within +-1 unit cell from the first selected
!p              atom will be chosen.
!p "slocal"   : Same as "local" only the second atom must be on the same
!p              site within the unit cell as the first one.
!p "site"     : Atom on the same site in any unit cell are allowed as
!p              second atom.
!p
4  move
!b set "move",{ "all" | <name> | <number> },<sx>,<sy>,<sz>

   Sets an user defined sigma for the generates moves. The created shifts
   are Gaussian distributed. The default is a sigma of 0.2 unit cell. Note
   that the values of <sx>, <sy> and <sz> are given in unit cell units to
   speed up the RMC runs. In case molecules are selected <number> specifies
   the molecule type, otherwise atoms are addressed by their <number> or
   <name>.
4  range
!b set "range","all"
!b set "range",<qmin>,<qmax>
!b set "range",<hmin>,<kmin>,<lmin>,<hmax>,<kmax>,<lmax>

   This command allows to set a range in Q which will be used for the
   RMC refinements. This can be useful if e.g. occupational disorder
   should only be refined based on the low Q part of the input data
   whereas the displacements should be refined using the complete
   diffuse scattering data set. 

   There are 3 ways to specify the Q range: "all" will use the complete
   input data set for the fit. The Q-range can be given as <qmin>, <qmax>
   ( in reciprocal A) or as hkl's (<hmin>,...,<lmax>).
4  scal
!b set "scal",{"on"|"off"},[<value>], [<plane>]

   This command controls if a scaling factor should be calculated and
   used for the RMC fits. If the calculation of the scaling factor is
   switched off it can be set to the value given by <value>. If no value
   is given, the default is 1. The second optional parameter allows to
   specify the plane the current value of <value> is set for. If the
   parameter <plane> is omitted, the value of <value> is set for ALL
   experimental data planes.
4  sigm
!b set "sigm",<sigma>

   This command sets the value for SIGMA. CHI2 is calculated by

!b    CHI2 = SUM (Fobs-Fcalc)**2/SIGMA**2

   The value of SIGMA is important for the calculation. A too large
   value will allow nearly every move and a too small value will 
   drive the fit in the nearest local minimum. The default value is 0.01
   If the value of SIGMA is set to zero, only moved improving the fit
   will be accepted.

   For test and debug runs a setting of SIGMA to -9999. will result
   in the acceptance of ALL moves.
4  sym
!b set "sym",{"on"|"off"}

   This commands controls the use of symmetric equivalent planes to the
   read data-planes for the RMC calculations. If this flag is set to "off",
   only the experimental data are used for CHI2 calculation, if the flag
   is "on" the symmetry of the measured data is taken into account.
3  show
!b show [<subcommand>]

   Shows the current parameter settings of the RMC subsection. The following
   subcommands allow to select certain parameters of interest. The allowed
   subcommands are:

!p "all"  : show all settings (same as calling 'show' without parameter)
!p "atom" : show selected atoms, minimal distances, ...
!p "data" : show information about experimental data
!p "mode" : show general RMC calculation settings
!p "rval" : show R-values for current refinement
!p "sym"  : show information about using symmetry information of read planes
2  save
!b save <name>

   saves the current structure to file <name>

   The format is identical to the unit cell or structure file. Each
   atom is written in format A4,3(2X,F11.6),5X,F6.4

   If the 'save' command is used with one parameter, the
   parameter is interpreted as output file name. See the entry
   ==> 'filenames' under the command language entry in the main help
   section on information about valid file names and file name substitution.
   The save menu is executed using the current default values and the
   standard DISCUS prompt returns.

   If the 'save' command is used without parameter, the save menu is
   called. At this menu you can define the output format of the structure
   file, its name, which information and which atoms to include.

3  commands
   Valid commands at this level are

!p @       ! Execute a macro file (see main help)
!p =       ! assigns the value to a variable (see main help)
!p asym    ! Shows asymmetric unit
!p chem    ! Shows the atoms present in the crystal
!p continue! Coninue a stopped macro (see main help level)
!p des     ! deselects atoms
!p echo    ! echo a string (see main help)
!p eval    ! Evaluates an expression for interactive check (see main help)
!p exit    ! terminates 'save'
!p file    ! Defines the file name to which the structure is written
!p format  ! Defines the format of the structure file
!p help    ! gives on line help for saving the structure (see main help)
!p omit    ! Defines which information to omit from the file
!p run     ! starts the saving of the structure
!p sel     ! selects atoms to be included in the structure file
!p show    ! shows the current parameters
!p stop    ! Stops execution of a macro (see main help level)
!p system  ! Executes operating system command (see main help)
!p wait    ! Waits for user input (see main help)
!p write   ! Defines which information to write to the file

3  asym
!b asym

   Shows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in
   the asymmetric unit.
3  chem
!b chem

   Displays the type of atoms present in the crystal. For each type of
   atom, its scattering curve number, its name and its temperature
   factor are listed.
   Warning, even, if all atoms of a particular type have been deleted, its 
   scattering type will remain in the list. This list could therefore 
   include more types of atoms than are actually present in the crystal.
3  des
!b des { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'sel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are deselected.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are deselected.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one atom may be deselected at once.
3  outfile
!b outfile <filename>

   Sets the name of the output file to which the structure is written.
3  format
!b format {"keyword" | "nokeyword" }

   The keyword controlled format uses keywords analogous to the commands 
   of DISCUS to describe the information in the structure file. See the
   help on "data" at the main help level for a complete listing of all
   keywords. A flexible number of keywords can be included at the header
   of the structure file ==> 'write' and 'omit'.

   The non-keyword controlled format writes a simplified file that contains
   only the following information:

!p Line 1:   Title up to 80 characters
!p line 2:   Space group symbol [,origin choice number]
!p line 3:   Lattice constants a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma

   and for each atom a line with:

!p           Name(4 characters) x  y  z  isotropic B


3  incl
!b incl { <start>,<end> | "all" }

   The unit cell transformation includes all atoms numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other atoms are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   unit cell transformation will include all atoms of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further atoms in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the unit cell transformations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the 
   unit cell transformation later on.
   In addition you can define the atoms that are affected by the 
   unit cell transformation operation with the ==>'sele' and 'dese' commands.

   "molecule"   Although the crystal contains molecules their type and 
                content is not written to the end of the structure file.
                WARNING: All information about molecules is lost!

   "object"     Although the crystal contains objects their type and 
                content is not written to the end of the structure file.

3  run
!b run

   Starts the transformation operation.
3  sel
!b sel { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   This command serves to select
   those atoms that will be modified by the unit cell transformation.

   Defines which atoms are included in unit cell transformations.
   Possible values for the first mandatory parameter are mutually
   exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are included.
             This includes the "voids" in the structure, which are stored
             as scattering curve number zero.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.

!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection made stay valid until explicitly deselected!
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current parameters of the transformation operation.
3  write
!b write { "all" | "generator" | "ncell" | "symmetry" | "molecule" |
!b         "object" | "domain" | "scat" | "adp" }

   The keyword controlled format includes the mandatory lines :
   title
   spcgrp
   cell
   atoms

   All other keywords are optional.

   "all"        All optional keywords are written to the structure
                file.

   "scat"       The list of all atom names is written to the structure
                file.

   "adp"        The list of all atomic displacement parameters is written
                to the structure file.

   "generator"  If additional generators were read from the input file
                they will be written to the structure file as well.

   "ncell"      The number of unit cells and the number of atoms in each
                unit cell are written to the structure file. The number
                of unit cells corresponds to the parameter used for the 
                'read/cell' command. These numbers are needed for a fast
                association between atom number and its unit cell inside
                a large crystal.
                Warning!!!! If you purged "voids" from the crystal, the
                number of atoms per unit cell is no longer constant 
                throughout the crystal and no fixed association exists
                between atom number and the corresponding unit cell. 
                Use of the purge command is discouraged !!!!!!

2  seed
!b seed [ <value> ]

   Reinitializes the pseudo random generator. The seed passed to the 
   random generator is -abs(nint(value)). If the <value> is omitted,
   the random generator will be passed the number of hundredth of 
   seconds passed since midnight, essentially initializing the sequence
   at a unknown fairly random point.
2  shear
!b shear

   This command enters the deformation menu. The commands in this
   subsection allow you to apply a deformation tensor to an object 
   or to a molecule. 

   You can define the deformation tensor by providing:
   - the matrix
   - a deformation plane and the deformation vector parallel to this plane.
   - the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the deformation tensor

   Further help is available on:
3  commands
!p calc    ! Calculate the deformation for a single vector
!p des     ! Deselect the atom types
!p eigen   ! Define the deformation through it's eigenvectors
!p hkl     ! Define the deformation plane 
!p incl    ! Include a range of atoms
!p matrix  ! Define the deformation tensor directly
!p mincl   ! Include a range of molecules
!p mdes    ! Deselect the molecule types
!p msel    ! Select molecule types
!p mode    ! Set the input mode (matrix, plane, eigenvectors)
!p oincl   ! Include a range of objects
!p origin  ! Define the orgin for the deformation 
!p osel    ! Select the object types
!p odes    ! Deselect the object types
!p run     ! Perform the actual deformation
!p sel     ! Select the atom types
!p show    ! Show the current settings
!p uvw     ! Define the deformation plane
!p vector  ! Define the deformation vector
3  calc
!b calc <x>,<y>,<z> {,<flag>}

   Calculates the effect of the current shear on vector <x>,<y>,<z>.
   The flag is allowed to be either "d" or "r", specifying a direct
   or reciprocal vector.
   The result is displayed on screen and stored in the result
   variable "res[]". 3 values are stored, <x'>,<y'>,and <z'>. 
3  des
!b des { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'sel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are deselected.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are deselected.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one atom may be deselected at once.
3  eigen
!b eigen <nr>, <x>,<y>,<z> {,<value>}

   Define the direction of the eigenvector number <nr>. <x>,<y>,<z> are
   the coordinates of the eigenvector in direct space. 

   If you give the last parameter, this is interpreted as the
   corresponding eigenvalue.
   If the last parameter is omitted, DISCUS will calculated the 
   length of the eigenvector and take this as the eigenvalue.

   In both cases, the eigenvector is normalized to unit length.

   The ==> 'show' command displays the Eigenvectors, the determinant
   of the eigenvector matrix, and the angles between the 
   three eigenvectors. This allows you to verify that all three 
   vectors are normal to each other.
3  hkl
!b hkl <h>,<k>,<l> [,<length>]

   Defines the deformation by providing a plane ==> 'hkl', 'uvw' and
   a deformation vector ==> 'vector'.

   'hkl' is the normal to the plane in reciprocal space coordinates.

   The object experiences a shear parallel to the plane. The 
   magnitude of the shift is defined by the deformation vector, 
   that shifts the point at the end of 'uvw' from the ==> 'origin'
   by its value =='vector'. 
   If the optional last parameter is given, the length of the normal
   ==> 'uvw' to the plane is normalized to this length, otherwise the 
   normal is taken as is. This parameter helps you e.q. in a monoclinic
   space, to aply a shift parallel to the (001) plane by specifying
   the ==> 'hkl' 0,0,1 and then giving a distance from this plane at
   which the shear vector ==> 'vector' is to act, e.g. the d-spacing 
   of the (001) planes.
   All points are shifted by an amount parallel to the deformation vector
   that is proportional to their distance from the plane. Points at 
   a distance equal to the length of 'uvw' are shifted by the vector, #
   those twice as far away are shifted twice as much. Points on 
   opposite sides of the plane are shifed in opposite directions.
3  incl
!b incl {<start>,<end> | "all" | "envi" }

   The shear operation includes all atoms numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other atoms are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   shear operation will include all atoms of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further atoms in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the shear operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the shear 
   operation later on.
   If the parameter "envi" is specified, the shear operation will 
   include all atoms in the current environment that was located by the 
   last ==> 'find env' command.
   In addition you can define the atoms that are affected by the 
   shear operation with the ==>'sele' and 'dese' commands.
3  matrix
!b matrix <11>,<12>,<13>,<21>,<22>,<23>,<31>,<32>,<33>

   This command defines explicitely the deformation tensor. All
   nine elements must be given.
3  mincl
!b mincl {<start>,<end> | "all" }

   The shear operation includes all molecules numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other molecules are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   shear operation will include all molecules of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further molecules in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the shear operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the shear 
   operation later on.
   In addition you can define the molecules that are affected by the 
   shear operation with the ==>'msele' and 'mdese' commands.
3  mdes
!b mdes { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'msel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all molecules of the crystal are deselected.
!p <number>  all molecules of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one molecule type may be deselected at once.
3  msel
!b msel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command serves to select
   those molecules that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which molecules are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all molecules of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes the empty molecules in the structure, which are
!p           stored as scattering curve number zero.
!p <number>  all molecules of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection of molecules by 'msel', objects by 'osel', and atoms 
   by 'sel' are mutually
   exclusive. The symmetry operation uses either atoms,objects  or molecules.
3  mode
!b mode {"eigen"|"matrix"|"plane"|"rmatrix"}

   You can tell DISCUS which input you intend to use for the 
   definition of the deformation tensor. The commands ==> 'uvw', 'hkl'
   'vector', 'matrix', rmatrix', and 'eigen' will automatically set 
   this flag as well. The last of these commands type befor the final
   ==> 'run' determines the actual input mode that is assumed.
3  odes
!b odes { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'osel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all objects of the crystal are deselected.
!p <number>  all objects of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one objects type may be deselected at once.
3  oincl
!b oincl {<start>,<end> | "all" }

   The shear operation includes all objects numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other objects are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   shear operation will include all objects of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further objects in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the shear operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the shear 
   operation later on.
   In addition you can define the objects that are affected by the 
   shear operation with the ==>'osele' and 'odese' commands.
3  origin
!b origin <x>,<y>,<z> [,{"crystal"|"molecule"]

   This commands sets the origin to which the shear operation refers to.

   If you selected atoms by ==> 'sel', the last optional parameter will
   alway default to an origin with respect to the crystal base system.
   The specified origin is subtracted from each atom position prior to the
   shear operation.

   If you selected molecules ==> 'msel' or objects ==> 'osel', the last
   optional parameter will be interpreted. 
   If it is set to "molecule", the origin is considerd to be at vector
   <x>,<y>,<z> relative to the origin of each individual molecule or
   object. All distances within the molecule or object are sheared 
   accordingly.
   If it is set to "crystal", the origin is considered to be at vector
   <x>,<y>,<z> relative to the crystal origin. The shear operation is
   applied to the origin of each molecule or object. The molecules or
   objects are now considered to be rigid units. Thus the shear operation
   will shift all atoms or objects with the shear that is applied at their
   respective origin but will not apply a shear to the internal distances.
3  osel
!b osel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command serves to select
   those objects that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which objects are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all objects of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes the empty objects in the structure, which are
!p           stored as scattering curve number zero.
!p <number>  all objects of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one object may be selected at once.

   The selection of objects by 'osel','msel' and atoms by 'sel' are mutually
   exclusive. The symmetry operation uses either atoms or molecules,
   or objects.
3  run
!b run

   Performs the actual deformation operation on the selected
   atom, molecule or object types.
3  sel
!b sel { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   This command executes serves to select
   those atoms that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which atoms are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are included.
             This includes the "voids" in the structure, which are stored
             as scattering curve number zero.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection made stay valid until explicitly deselected!
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current settings.
3  uvw
!b uvw <u>,<v>,<w> [,<length>]

   Defines the deformation by providing a plane ==> 'hkl', 'uvw' and
   a deformation vector ==> 'vector'.

   'uvw' is the normal to the plane in direct space coordinates.

   The object experiences a shear parallel to the plane. The 
   magnitude of the shift is defined by the deformation vector, 
   that shifts the point at the end of 'uvw' from the ==> 'origin'
   by its value =='vector'. 
   If the optional last parameter is given, the length of the normal
   ==> 'uvw' to the plane is normalized to this length, otherwise the 
   normal is taken as is. This parameter helps you e.q. in a monoclinic
   space, to aply a shift parallel to the (001) plane by specifying
   the ==> 'hkl' 0,0,1 and then giving a distance from this plane at
   which the shear vector ==> 'vector' is to act, e.g. the d-spacing 
   of the (001) planes.
   All points are shifted by an amount parallel to the deformation vector
   that is proportional to their distance from the plane. Points at 
   a distance equal to the length of 'uvw' are shifted by the vector, #
   those twice as far away are shifted twice as much. Points on 
   opposite sides of the plane are shifed in opposite directions.
3  vector
!b vector <x>,<y>,<z>

   Defines the deformation by providing a plane ==> 'hkl', 'uvw' and
   a deformation vector ==> 'vector'.

   The object experiences a shear parallel to the plane. The 
   magnitude of the shift is defined by the deformation vector, 
   that shifts the point at the end of 'uvw' from the ==> 'origin'
   by its value =='vector'. 
   All points are shifted by an amount parallel to the deformation vector
   that is proportional to their distance from the plane. Points at 
   a distance equal to the length of 'uvw' are shifted by the vector, #
   those twice as far away are shifted twice as much. Points on 
   opposite sides of the plane are shifed in opposite directions.
2  show

   hows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in

   reset to the last atom in the crystal.
3  result
!b show "result"

   The result array is shown on screen. The number of values shown
   depends on the last calculation performed.

   Further information about the crystal, its composition etc can be obtained
   by evaluating the corresponding ==> variable.
3  scat
!b show "scat", {<name> | <number> } [, {<name> | <number> }...]

       the symmetry matrix as (3x4) matrix
       the symbol as printed in the International Tables
       the resulting atom positions xyz, as printed in the International Tables

   For each symmetry operation DISCUS lists the number in square brackets,
   and for centered space groups the number within each block that corresponds
   to one centering vector in round brackets. With the setting 
   ==> set generator,symmetry the sequence corresponds to that listed
   in the Tables.

   xyz, as used in the International Tables.

!p "matrix"

   This produces a list that consists of the (3x4) symmetry matrices.
2  stack
!b stack

   Switches to the stacking fault submenu of DISCUS. 
   At this sub menu you create a crystal containing stacking faults.
   Several types of layers can be stacked on top of each other. At present
   these layers are read from file. In future releases you will be able to
   call a macro that creates the layer. A layer could be a 2-dimensional
   layer of atoms or unit cells of any thickness or a 1-dimensional row
   of atoms or unit cells.
   The translation vectors from one layer type to the next can be defined
   and need not be exact values but can be Gaussian distributed. 
   A correlation matrix defines the probabilities of layer sequences.
   These probabilities only include first neighbor interactions.

   Alternatively to the stacking faults ruled by the correlations, you
   can include random stacking faults. These stacking faults choose at 
   random the next layer type and the translation vector.

   You can create the crystal following two alternate choices: 

   1) The origin of the current layer is the sum of the previous origin
      and the translation vector

   2) The above origin is taken modulo the modulus vectors.

   By using the first option, the crystal continuously grows in one 
   direction as given by the translation vector(s). By using the second
   option the origins are restricted to a finite range around the 
   average translation vector, which results in a zig-zag shaped crystal.

   The menu includes a new approach to calculate the Fourier transform that
   saves considerable computational time.

   If the modulus is switched on ==> 'set modulus', and the mode of the
   translation ==> 'set trans' is set to "fixed", this vector is used.
3  ccol
!b ccol <nr>,<c1nr>,<c2nr>,...,<cmdtypenr>

   Read a single column <nr> of the correlation matrix. Following the
   index <nr>, as many parameters as there are layer types must follow.
   The sum of any column need not be equal to one.
3  cele
!b cele <i>,<j>,<value>

   Creates the list of layer origins. No changes are done to the 
   actual structure, this is performed by the command ==> 'run'.
3  crow
!b crow <nr>,<cnr>1,<cnr>2,...,<cnrmdtype>

   Read a single row <nr> of the correlation matrix. Following the
   index <nr>, as many parameters as there are layer types must follow.
   The sum of any row need not be equal to one, as long as the sum of all
   rows is identical.
3  dist
!b dist { "matrix" | "file", <inputfile> | "list", <inputfile> }

   This commands allows you to define how the sequence of layer types
   is determined.
   The parameter "matrix" forces DISCUS to determine the type of each
   layer from the correlation matrix ==> 'crow', 'ccol'. Only 
   nearest neighbor correlations are realized.

   The parameter "file" forces DISCUS to read a standard structure 
   file from <inputfile>. The atom types found in this file are 
   interpreted as to correspond to the respective layer type. 
   Make sure this is a one-dimensional structure and that you have 
   written this file using the ==> 'save' options to write the
   explicit list of scattering types and atomic displacement parameters.
   You can use the MonteCarlo section of DISCUS ==> 'mc' to create
   the list of layer types, which allows you to include nearest as well
   as next nearest etc neighbor correlations.
   Presently 'stack' ignores the atom positions found in the input file.
   The layer origins are calculated using the translations ==> 'tran'.

   The parameter "list" acts very similarly to "file". The only difference
   is that the atom positions are interpreted as layer positions as well.

   DISCUS does not check whether the atoms in <inputfile> form a 
   1-dimensional list of atoms, or whether this 1-dimensional line
   is not parallel to the layers! 
   This can actually be used to distribute equally sized and oriented
   domains throughout the crystal. In combination with the stacking fault
   fourier option, very fast Fourier transformations of molecular
   crystals can be calculated.
3  four
!b four

   A crystal with stacking faults can be created in the following step wise
   manner:

!p   1. Create the distribution of layer origins. 
!p   2. Convolute each origin with the corresponding layer.

   At this point, the convolution theorem saves a lot of computation time
   since the Fourier transform of a convolution is equal to the product
   of the individual Fourier transforms. The Fourier transform approach
   realized in the stacking fault menu operates by the following steps:

!p   0. The current parameters of the ==> 'fourier' menu are used.
!p   1. For each layer type calculate the Fourier transform of the 
!p      list of origins. 
!p      Calculate the Fourier transform of the actual atoms in the layer.
!p      Multiply the resulting complex amplitudes and store the results
!p      in temporary files.
!p   2. Add the complex amplitudes from all layer types and store the
!p      result in internal memory.

   The user can then write any desired output value using the ==>'output'
   sub menu.

!b Note:
   In order to calculate the Fourier transform of each layer type the atoms
   in the corresponding file are read into the internal structure array.
   A previous structure is lost! If necessary save this structure to file
   by the ==> 'save' command.

!b Note:
   DISCUS does not compare the space group or lattice constants in the 
   different layer files. You must make sure that these are identical.
3  layer
!b layer <filename>

   Defines a new layer type.
   The file <filename> must be a standard DISCUS input file that contains
   a list of atoms. No restrictions apply to the position and types of 
   atoms in the layer. You have to create the layer beforehand using the
   tools of DISCUS.
3  modulus
!b modulus <x1>,<y1>,<z1>, <x2>,<y2>,<z2>

   Sets the two moduli vectors that are used to restrict the origins to
   a finite volume around the average translation vector. The plane
   defined by these two vectors need not to be normal to the average
   translation.

!p ==> 'set mod'
!p ==> 'set tran'
!p ==> 'aver'

   You can create the crystal following two alternate choices: 

!p   1) The origin of the current layer is the sum of the previous origin
!p      and the translation vector
!p   2) The above origin is taken modulo the modulus vector.

   By using the first option, the crystal continuously grows in one 
   direction as given by the translation vector(s). By using the second
   option one or two coordinates can be constrained to a finite range, which
   results in a zig-zag shaped crystal. If any of the parameters is not
   equal to zero, the corresponding coordinate of the origin is taken modulo
   this parameter. 

   DISCUS does NOT check whether the moduli vectors are translation vectors
   of the current space group!
3  number
!b number <n>

   Reads the number of layers to be created.
3  random
!b random prob,<value>
!b random offset,< u>,< v>,< w>
!b random sigma ,<su>,<sv>,<sw>
 
   This command sets values for the random stacking faults. The program
   selects the next layer type by weighted random choice. The weights
   are chosen according to the overall probabilities for each layer type.
   The next layer is then shifted by the corresponding translation vector
   between the resulting neighbors. In addition a random fraction of the 
   two moduli vectors is added, which results in a random distribution
   of the next layer origin.

!b random prob,<value>
   Sets the probability for random stacking faults. <value> must be between
   zero and one. Set the probability to zero to exclude random stacking
   faults.
   
!b random offset,< u>,< v>,< w>
   If specified this vector is added to the translation vector. You can
   use this offset to force an increased layer separation for random
   faults compared to regular stacking faults.

!b random sigma ,<su>,<sv>,<sw>
   Specifies the sigma's for a Gaussian distribution applied to the 
   components of the offset.
3  rese
!b rese

   Sets the number of layers and layer types back to zero.
3  rotate
!b rotate axis,  "normal",<u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]
!b rotate axis,  "mod1",  <u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]
!b rotate axis,  "mod2",  <u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]
!b rotate mode, [ "all" | "fault" ]
!b rotate sigma, "normal",<snormal> 
!b rotate sigma, "mod1",  <smod1>
!b rotate sigma, "mod2",  <smod2>
!b rotate status,  [ "on" | "off" ]

   This command sets values for rotational disorder of the stacking faults.
   The layers are rotated around three axes, which are defined by the 
   'axis' command. The angle of rotation is Gaussian distributed with mean
   value zero and sigma defined by the 'sigma' command.

!b rotate axis,  "normal",<u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]
!b rotate axis,  "mod1",  <u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]
!b rotate axis,  "mod2",  <u>,<v>,<w> [ "d" | "r" ]

   The parameter "axis" defines the three axes around which you can rotate
   the layers. The axis can be given in real space coordinates "d" or
   reciprocal space coordinates "r". Default is real space.
   DISCUS does not make any assumptions about the three axes. The layer
   is rotated first around the "normal" axis, then around "mod1" and finally
   around "mod2". It is suggested to define "normal" as the axis perpendicular
   to the layers and "mod1" and "mod2" within the plane of the layers.

   Attention!!
   If you tilt the layer around "mod1" or "mod2" the outer sections of the
   layer might overlap with the previous layer!

!b rotate mode, [ "all" | "fault" ]

   The rotational disorder can affect all layers individually, regardless
   whether the previous layer was of the same type as the current layer or
   not.
   Alternatively, a new rotation angle is computed only at a stacking fault,
   i.e. if the current layer type is different than the previous layer type.
   All following layers of identical type up to the next stacking fault are
   rotated by the same angle.

!b rotate sigma, "normal",<snormal> 
!b rotate sigma, "mod1",  <smod1>
!b rotate sigma, "mod2",  <smod2>

   The rotation is Gaussian distributed with individual sigma for each axis.
   The mean value of the distribution is zero. Each new angle is calculated
   individually from a Gaussian distribution irrespective of the previous
   value. This forces the average layer orientations to remain constant
   throughout the crystal.
   A sigma of zero fixes the rotations around the respective axis to zero.

!b rotate status,  [ "on" | "off" ]

   The rotational disorder is only effective if its status is switched "on".
3  run
!b run

   Decorates the origins with the corresponding atom distribution. Any
   previously existing structure is lost.
3  set
!b set "aver",<value>
!b set "modulus" , { "off" | "on" }
!b set "trans" , { "calculate" | "fixed" }

!b set "aver",<value>
   If the value of <value> is not equal to zero, the average <F> is
   subtracted from the actual structure factor F. 
   Otherwise the average <F> is calculated using the whole crystal
   and subtracted from the actual F.

!p ==> "four"
!p ==> "discus four set aver"

!b set "modulus" , { "off" | "on" }
   If the modulus is set "off", each origin is calculated by adding
   the corresponding translation vector to the previous origin. This
   way the crystal grows along the average translation vector. The 
   resulting average translation vector is the sum of all translation
   vectors weighted by the corresponding probability as stored in
   the correlation matrix.
   If the modulus is set "on", each origin is calculated as above. The
   origin is then expressed as multiples of the two moduli vectors and
   the average translation. If any of the two multipliers corresponding
   to the two moduli vectors is larger than |1|, the moduli vector is
   subtracted from the origin. This has the effect that all origins are
   no further than the moduli vectors from the average translation.
   Even though all translation vectors might point in one direction,
   you can restrict the crystal to any arbitrary direction by defining
   the average vector ==> 'set trans', ==> 'aver'.

!b set "trans" , { "calculate" | "fixed" }
   You have two choices to restrict the crystal growth once the 
   modulus is set on.
   The average translation can be fixed to the value given by
   ==> 'aver' by setting the parameter of the 'set trans' command to
   "fixed". Alternatively the average translation is computed using
   the array of the translation vectors and the correlation matrix.

3  sigma
!b sigma <i>,<j>,<sx>,<sy>,<sz>

   Read the sigmas of the translation vector between layer type <i> and <j>.
   The current origin of any layer is calculated by adding the translation
   vector ==> 'trans' between layer types <i> and <j> to the previous origin.
   If any sigma is non-zero, a Gaussian distributed value with mean value of
   zero is added to the corresponding vector component.
3  trans
!b trans <i>,<j>,<tx>,<ty>,<tz>

   Reads the components of the translation vector between layers <i> and <j>.
   The current origin of any layer is calculated by adding the translation
   vector between layer types <i> and <j> to the previous origin.

!b boundary "sphere",<radius> [,{"inside"}|{"outside"}]
!b boundary "cylinder",<radius>,<half-height> [,{"inside"}|{"outside"}]

   This commands removes all atoms that are outside a boundary surrounding
   the crystal. 
   "hkl"  The surface is defined as a plane through the Miller indices 
          <h>,<k>,<l>. The optional <distance> determines the distance 
          between 0,0,0 and the boundary surface. Without this parameter,
          the distance is automatically calculated from the user supplied
          <h>,<k>,<l> as 1./dstar(h,k,l).
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are on the same side of the plane as is the origin. 
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the other side of the plane as the origin.
   "sphere" The boundary is defined as a sphere at the origin of direct
          space. The size of the sphere is defined by its radius in Angstroem.
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are inside the sphere.
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the outside of the sphere.
   "cylinder"  The boundary is defined as a cylinder of radius <radius>
          and half-height <height>, both measures are in Angstroem. The 
          cylinder axis is always along the c-axis. The top and bottom
          planes are parallel to the (001) plane. If the a- and b-axes are
          not at 90 degrees to the c-axis, the top will be tilted 
          accordingly. If necessary, transform into an orthogonal cell
          prior to the application of the boundary command.
          The optional last parameter determines which atoms remain.
          If the parameter is "inside" or omitted, all atoms remain that
          are inside the sphere.
          If the parameter is "outside", those atoms remain that are on 
          the outside of the sphere.

   Defines the distances between those atoms in <atom_list> and the
   specified surface. All atoms of the selected type that are closer
   than <distance> to the specified surface are marked as "close". The
   respective property can be used everywhere an atom type is selected.

   The surface is an internal surface between atoms that are inserted
   through a ==> 'domain' and the host structure.

   "all"
   The distances apply to both surface type

   <atom_list>
   List of atoms for which the <distance> is to apply. The list can be
   the "all" keyword or a list of atom names.

   <distance>
   Distance in Angstroem between an atom and the surface. If set to
   zero, the flag is not set.

   Instead of the aom list, the values can be set for all atoms to:

   "default"
   A default value of 2.55 Angstroem for all atoms.

   "off"
   A value of zero Angstroem. No surface property flag will be set.

2  switch
!b switch <atom1>,<atom2>
!b switch <mole1>,<mole2>,"mol"

   The atoms number <atom1> and <atom2> switch position. Internally, the
   chemistry of the two atoms is switched, while the positions remain
   as before.
   The corresponding properties are switched as well.

   If 'mol' is given as a third parameter, molecules <mole1> and <mole2>
   are interchanged. The origin of the two molecules (position of atom 1)
   are unchanged.
2  symmetry
!b symmetry

   Switches to the symmetry submenu of DISCUS. You can define a general 
   symmetry operation in triclinic space such as a rotation around a 
   general axis by a general angle. DISCUS performs a symmetry operation 
   in general triclinic space according to the matrix notation:

!p r' = S*r + t

   Here, r is the original position, r' its image, S the symmetry matrix
   and t the translation vector.  There are no restrictions on the direction 
   of the symmetry axis, the rotation angle or the translational part.   
   You can use this feature to create a twinned crystal, to rotate a group 
   of atoms around a general axis etc.

3  angle
!b angle <value>

   Sets the angle of the symmetry operation. The angle must be given in
   degrees. No limit applies to the numerical value.
3  asym
!b asym

   Shows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in
   the asymmetric unit.
3  calc
!b calc x,y,z [,"d" | "r" ]

   Calculates the symmetry transformation for a single point <x,y,z>.
   The current settings for the symmetry operation are used to transform
   the vector <x,y,z>. The result is displayed and stored in the result
   array "res".
   By default, or if the optional fourth parameter is set to "d", DISCUS
   assumes that the vector is a real space vector.i
   If the optional fourth parameter is set to "r" the vector is interpreted
   as a reciprocal space vector and the corresponding symmetry matrix in
   reciprocal space is used.
3  chem
!b chem

   Displays the type of atoms present in the crystal. For each type of
   atom, its scattering curve number, its name and its temperature
   factor are listed.
   Warning, even, if all atoms of a particular type have been deleted, its 
   scattering type will remain in the list. This list could therefore 
   include more types of atoms than are actually present in the crystal.
3  des
!b des { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'sel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are deselected.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are deselected.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one atom may be deselected at once.
3  hkl
!b hkl <h>,<k>,<l>

   Specifies the direction of the symmetry axis in reciprocal space
   coordinates. The corresponding direct space coordinates are calculated 
   by the program.
   Alternatively you may specify the direction in direct space by the
   ==> 'uvw" command.
3  incl
!b incl {<start>,<end> | "all" | "envi" }

   The symmetry operation includes all atoms numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other atoms are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   symmetry operation will include all atoms of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further atoms in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the symmetry operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the symmetry 
   operation later on.
   If the parameter "envi" is specified, the symmetry operation will 
   include all atoms in the current environment that was located by the 
   last ==> 'find env' command.
   In addition you can define the atoms that are affected by the 
   symmetry operation with the ==>'sele' and 'dese' commands.
3  mdes
!b mdes { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'msel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all molecules of the crystal are deselected.
!p <number>  all molecules of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one molecule type may be deselected at once.
3  mincl
!b mincl {<start>,<end> | "all" }

   The symmetry operation includes all molecules numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other molecules are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   symmetry operation will include all molecules of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further molecules in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the symmetry operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the symmetry

   In addition you can define the molecules that are affected by the 
   symmetry operation with the ==>'msele' and 'mdese' commands.
3  mode
!b mode { "copy" | "repl" } [ , { "new" | "old" } ]

   The symmetry operation can have two different effects on the current
   atom. In the "copy" mode, the symmetry operation creates a copy of the
   current atom. In the "repl" mode, the symmetry operation moves the
   current atom from its old position to the new position.

   The optional second parameter has only an effect if molecules are
   used. It determines if the new molecule created by the symmetry
   operation has is of the same type as the original ("old") or is
   treated as a new molecule type ("new").
3  msel
!b msel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command executes serves to select
   those molecules that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which molecules are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all molecules of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes the empty molecules in the structure, which are
!p           stored as scattering curve number zero.
!p <number>  all molecules of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection of molecules by 'msel' and atoms by 'sel' are mutually
   exclusive. The symmetry operation uses either atoms or molecules.
3  odes
!b odes { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'osel' . Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all objects of the crystal are deselected.
!p <number>  all objects of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one object type may be deselected at once.
3  oincl
!b oincl {<start>,<end> | "all" }

   The symmetry operation includes all objects numbered <start> to <end>
   inclusively. All other objects are ignored. 
   If, instead of explicit numbers, the parameter "all" is given, the
   symmetry operation will include all objects of the crystal. This holds
   even, if at a later time you include further objects in the crystal.
   Thus, you can define a setup for the symmetry operations early in a
   lengthy macro, then modify the crystal and just run the symmetry 
   operation later on.
   In addition you can define the objects that are affected by the 
   symmetry operation with the ==>'osele' and 'odese' commands.
3  origin
!b origin <x>,<y>,<z> [, { "mol" | "cryst" } ]

   Specifies the origin of the symmetry operation in direct space coordinates.
   The symmetry axis intersects this point and has the direction specified
   by ==> 'hkl' or 'uvw'. If the symmetry operation is an improper rotation,
   the center of symmetry is at <x>,<y>,<z>.

   In case of molecules to be transformed, the optional last parameter
   specifies if the given origin is relative to the origin of the
   molecule ("mol") or the crystal ("cryst"). Note that the first
   atom within a molecule has to be on the molecules origin (see manual).
3  osel
!b osel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command serves to select
   those objects that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which objects are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all objects of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes the empty objects in the structure, which are
!p           stored as scattering curve number zero.
!p <number>  all molecules of the crystal that are of type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection of objects by 'osel' and atoms by 'sel' are mutually
   exclusive. The symmetry operation uses either atoms or objects.
3  power
!b power <n> {, "multiple" | "single" }

   Sets the power of the symmetry operation. The symmetry operation is
   applied <n> times.

   If the ==> 'mode' of the symmetry operation is "repl", the second
   parameter is meaningless. The symmetry operation that applies in
   this case is :

!p        n         n 
!p  r' = S  * r  + t 

   The atom is moved to the new position that results from an <n> fold 
   application of the symmetry operation.

   If the ==> 'mode' of the symmetry operation is "copy", <n> new atoms
   are created. The position of the first atom results from a single
   application of the symmetry operation, the position of the second from
   a twofold application etc. 
3  run
!b run

   Starts the symmetry operation.
3  sel
!b sel { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   This command serves to select
   those atoms that will be modified by the symmetry operation.

   Defines which atoms are included in symmetry operation. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are included.
             This includes the "voids" in the structure, which are stored
             as scattering curve number zero.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection made stay valid until explicitly deselected!
3  show
!b show

   Shows the current parameters of the symmetry operation.
3  trans
!b trans <t1>,<t2>,<t3>

   Sets the translational part of the symmetry operation. 
   The translation is applied after the rotation according to the matrix
   notation:

!p r' = S*r + t

   Here, r is the original position, r' its image, S the symmetry matrix
   and t the translation vector.
3  type
!b type {"proper" | "improper" }

   A general rotation may be either a "proper" or an "improper" rotation. 
   An improper rotation is a normal rotation followed by an inversion. 
   To create, for example, a mirror operation specify a 180 degree angle
   and an improper rotation.
3  uvw
!b uvw <h>,<k>,<l>

   Specifies the direction of the symmetry axis in direct space
   coordinates. The corresponding reciprocal space coordinates are calculated 
   by the program.
   Alternatively you may specify the direction in reciprocal space by the
   ==> 'hkl" command.

   terminates 'wave' returns to the normal discus prompt
2  transform
!b tran

   Switches to the unit cell transformation submenu of DISCUS. 
   At this sublevel you can define the relationship between an old and a
   new unit cell and perform the transformation of the atoms in the crystal.
   An interactive transformation allows to calculate the result for any 
   single real and reciprocal space vector in both directions:
   old ==> new and new ==> old.

   You can specify the relation ship between the two unit cells in any of
   four possible options:
   define the new base vectors a,b,c in terms of the old base
   define the old base vectors a,b,c in terms of the new base
   define the new coordinates x,y,z in terms of the old coordinates
   define the old coordinates x,y,z in terms of the new coordinates
   define the new base vectors a*,b*,c* in terms of the old reciprocal base
   define the old base vectors a*,b*,c* in terms of the new reciprocal base

   Independent of the choice above, you can define an optional shift of the
   origin by:
   defining the coordinates of the new origin in terms of the old base
   defining the coordinates of the old origin in terms of the new base

   If all atoms in the crystal are transformed to the new base vectors, then
   the unit cell dimensions and the metric tensors are transformed as well. 
   The space group is set to "P1" to prevent erroneous symmetry operations
   once the present crystal is saved to file and read again. All original
   symmetry operations are transformed and stored as additional generators.

2  ther
!b ther [{"all" | "2d"}]
!b ther "mol",[{"all" | "2d"}]

   Randomly displaces all atoms according to their respective isotropic
   thermal coefficient. The directions of the displacements are distributed
   in uniform random distribution, the amplitude of the displacements
   are Gaussian distributed with FWHM calculated from the isotropic B.
   As default the displacements are performed in all 3 dimensions. For
   2d simulations however, the displacement in all directions corresponding
   to a size of one unit cell can be switched off by the parameter "2d".
   The value "all" is equal to the default.

   If the second parameter is set to "mol", the complete rigid molecule
   is displaced according to the temperature factor of the atom at the
   origin of the molecule.
2  variables
   The program recognizes free variables:

!p "i[ ]"  integer variables
!p "r[ ]"  real variables

   The current implementation allows 10 free variables [0] through [59] each.

!p "res[ ]"  Result of several calculations that return more than one

!p           The values of "res" change every time, a command is applied
!p           that returns more than one value. The old values are lost !

   Several other variables are linked to structural values:

!p                 ==> "find"
!p                 "env[0]" is the number of neighbours.

!p "menv[<i>]"      Index of neighbouring molecules as found by 
!p                 ==> "find"
!p                 "menv[0]" is the number of neighbours.

!p mol_cont[i1,i2] Content of molecule number i1.
!p                 mol_cont[i1,0] gives the number of
!p                 atoms in the molecule. For <i2> > 0, the
!p                 information about the <i2>'nd atom in the
!p                 molecule is given. The number of the
!p                 atom in the crystal is returned.
!p                 read only
!p mol_len[i1]     Number of atoms in molecule i1.
!p                 read only
!p mole_type[i1]   Type of molecule no. i1
!p                 read only

   The variables can be assigned constant numbers:

!p i[0] =  1               ! Integer variable no 0 is set to "1"
!p r[4] =  1.5             ! Real variable no 4 is set to "1.5"
!p x[5] = -2.7888          ! x-coordinate of atom 5 is set to "-2.7888"

   Arithmetic expressions may be used on the right hand side:

!p i[i[4]+2] = 2.0*(i[2]+i[0])/(i[2]**2)
!p m[i[0]+50] = m[i[0]] ! The atom 50 atoms down the line from
!p                        atom no <i[0]> is assigned the same
!p                        scattering curve, thus essentially switching
!p                        its chemistry around !

   As shown in the example above, arithmetic operations can be nested
   and grouped by brackets "(" and ")".
2  vprod
!b vprod <u1>,<v1>,<w1>,<u2>,<v2>,<w2> [ ,<flag> ]

   This command calculates the vector product <uvw 1> X <uvw 2>.
   The <flag> is a string of three characters that indicates whether the
   input vectors or the output vector are given in direct or reciprocal
   space coordinates. The three characters correspond to: 

!p    first input vector,
!p    second input vector
!p    resulting vector

!p "drd" means: vector one is given in direct space coordinates, vector 2
!p              is in reciprocal space coordinates (hkl) and the
!p              resulting vector product is to be given in direct space
!p              coordinates

   Any combination of "d" and "r" is allowed.

   The output vector is stored in the result variable:
   "res[1]","res[2]","res[3]" vector product of vector 1 and vector 2

3  acco
!b acco

   Sets the wave type to acoustic, atoms of opposite charge are
   displaced in the same direction.
3  amp
!b amp <value>

   sets the amplitude in Angstrom
3  asym
!b asym

   Shows the content of the asymmetric unit. The names of those atoms,
   a number that is used as index for its scattering type, their position
   and temperature coefficient are listed. The number that is listed,
   is the number that refers to the scattering curve of that atom. It is
   contained in the variable m[<index>]. If a cell was read, all atoms
   are considered to be different, even if they are chemically identical
   and have the same temperature coefficient. If a whole structure was
   read, all atoms that are in the unit cell 0 <= xyz < 1, are chemically
   unique and have a different temperature coefficient are included in
   the asymmetric unit.
3  chem
!b chem

   Displays the type of atoms present in the crystal. For each type of
   atom, its scattering curve number, its name and its temperature
   factor are listed.
   Warning, even, if all atoms of a particular type have been deleted, its 
   scattering type will remain in the list. This list could therefore 
   include more types of atoms than are actually present in the crystal.
3  dens
!b dens

   Sets the type of the wave to be a density wave. All atoms selected
   by 'sel' or 'repl' will be modulated by the wave. The probability
   with which an atom is present oscillates between 'plow' and 'phigh'.
3  des
!b des { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   Deselects choices made by ==> 'sel' or ==> 'repl'. Possible values
   for the parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are deselected.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are deselected.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are deselected.

   More than one atom may be deselected at once.
3  func
!b func "box" [,<delta>]
!b func "sinus"
!b func "triang" 

   Sets the type of wave function used. The parameter can be any of the 
   strings listed.

   A) displacement waves:

!p "box"   : A box shaped wave function is used. The function is 
!p           symmetrical around the origin. This, however, can be
!p           changed by changing the phase at the origin, see command
!p           ==> 'phase'. The default is a symmetrical box function,
!p           i.e. a value of <delta> of 0.5. The value of <delta>
!p           can be given as additional parameter to us an asymmetric
!p           box function, i.e. maxima and minima have different widths.
!p "sinus" : A sinusoidal wave function is used. The displacement is given
!p           by amp*SIN(arg).
!p "triang": A triangular displacement is applied. The displacement linearly
!p           increases from zero to amp and drops back to zero at the end
!p           of the wave. The point at 0/4 = 4/4 wave length has displacement
!p           zero.

   The constant shift is added to these displacements.

   B) replacement waves:

!p "box"   : A box shaped wave function is used. The occupation probability
!p           of the original atom, see ==> 'repl', is equal to <plow> along 
!p           half the wave length and <phigh> else. Other details were
!p           given above.
!p "sinus" : A sinusoidal wave function is used. The occupation probability
!p           is given by 
!p              amp * SIN(arg) + amp0, where
!p              amp = 0.5*( phigh-plow)
!p              amp0= 0.5*( phigh+plow)
!p           This will give a sinusoidal wave with minimum at <plow> and
!p           maximum value at <phigh>.
!p "triang": A triangular occupation probability is applied. The occupation
!p           probability linearly increases from <plow> to <phigh> and drops
!p           back to zero at the end of the wave.
!p           The point at 0/4 = 4/4 wave length has the occupation
!p           probability of <plow>.
3  len
!b len <value>

   Sets the wave length in Angstrom
3  long
!b long

   Sets the wave type to longitudinal
3  mdes
!b mdes { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command deselects all or individual molecule types used for
   the plotting output.
3  msel
!b msel { "all" | <number> } [ , <number> ...]

   This command allows to select the molecule types to be used for
   the plotting output. By using 'msel' the atom selection becomes
   invalid. The parameter "all" will select ALL molecule types.
   Alternatively individual molecule types can be selected using the
   corresponding <number>. In order to use atoms again, use the 'sele'
   command.
3  mrep
!b mrep <typ1>,<typ2> [,"viceversa"]

   This command selects the molecules that will be replaced by a density 
   function. The parameter <typ1> specifies the molecule type to 
   eventually be replaced by type <typ2>. Repeat the command to select
   more than one molecule type. To deselect use 'mdes'. To remove the
   molecules rather than replacing them, set <typ2> to zero.

   If the third optional parameter "viceversa" is given, the molecules 
   of type <typ2> are replaced by molecules of type <typ1> with the 
   opposite probability. 
   This is useful, if you have a random arrangement of molecule types
   <typ1> and <typ2> and would like to obtain a density wave that 
   fluctuates between these two types. If the optional parameter is
   omitted, only molecules of type <typ1> are replaced and all 
   molecules of type <typ2> are not changed. 
   Keep in mind that you should select only those molecules that you 
   want to exchange, and do not use the ==> msel all construction.
3  rot
!b rot <u>,<v>,<w> [,<x>,<y>,<z>]

   This command selects the rotational wave mode which is only available
   when using molecules. The wave amplitude is here used as rotation angle
   rather than as displacement or probability as for the other modes.
   The parameters <u>,<v>,<w> define the rotation axis in real space. The
   origin of the rotation axis is the origin of the molecule. However,
   an offset <x>,<y>,<z> for this origin can be specified as optional
   parameters.
3  opti
!b opti

   Sets the wave type to optical, atoms of opposite charge are
   displaced in opposite directions.
3  osci
!b osci <x,y,z>

   Sets the direction of the oscillation vector for transverse
   waves.
3  phase
!b phase { <value> | "random" }

   Sets the phase of the wave at 0,0,0 in direct space in degrees.
   The initial phase is zero. With phase = 0, a sine wave
   results, with phase = 90 a cosine wave.
3  phigh
!b phigh <value>

   Sets the upper probability limit, with which an atom is retained by a
   density wave. The maximum occupancy of the atom reaches <value>. 
3  plow
!b plow <value>

   Sets the lower probability limit, with which an atom is retained by a
   density wave. The minimum occupancy of the atom reaches <value>.
3  repl
!b repl { "all" | <name> | <number> } , { <name> | <number> } [,"viceversa"]

   This command selects those atoms that will be replaced by a density 
   function. Possible values for the first mandatory parameter are mutually 
   exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are replaced by the atom defined
!p           by the second parameter.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are replaced by
!p           the atom defined by the second parameter. This includes
!p           symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <name>
!p           are replaced by the atom defined by the second parameter.

   The second parameter defines the atom, the original is replaced by.
   If a name is given, it need not to be present in the original crystal.
   A new scattering type is automatically added to the table. If a number
   is given, to which no corresponding atom exists, an error message is
   displayed.

   If the third optional parameter "viceversa" is given, the atoms 
   of the first type are replaced by atoms of the second type with the 
   opposite probability. 
   This is useful, if you have a random arrangement of atoms types
   and would like to obtain a density wave that 
   fluctuates between these two types. If the optional parameter is
   omitted, only atoms of the first type are replaced and all 
   atoms of the second type are not changed. 
   Keep in mind that you should select only those atoms that you 
   want to exchange, and do not use the ==> sel all construction.

3  run
!b run

   Starts the calculation of the wave
3  sel
!b sel { "all" | <name> | <number> } [ , { <name> | <number> } ...]

   This command serves to select
   those atoms that will be modified by a wave function.

   Defines which atoms are included in a wave. Possible values
   for the first mandatory parameter are mutually exclusively:

!p "all"     all atoms of the crystal are included.
             This includes the "voids" in the structure, which are stored
             as scattering curve number zero.
!p <name>    all the atoms called <name> of the crystal are included.
!p           This includes symmetrically not equivalent atoms.
!p <number>  all atoms of the crystal that are of scattering type <number>
!p           are included.

   More than one atom may be selected at once.

   The selection made stay valid until explicitly deselected!
3  shift
!b shift <amount>

   A constant shift <amount> is added to the displacement of the atoms
3  show
!b show

   shows the current settings for the wave.
3  tran
!b tran

   sets the wave type to transverse
3  vect
!b vect <x,y,z>

   sets the direction of the wave vector in units of the lattice
   constants. The wave length has to be set with ==> "len".
2  wyckoff
!b wyckoff <x>,<y>,<z> [,{"full" | "symbol" | "xzy" | "matrix" }

   Shows all symmetry operations that copy an atom at position <x>,<y>,<z>
   onto itself. These are the symmetry operations of the current space group,
   not the simple point group symmetry.

!p "full"

   The default setting, produces a full listing. This includes:
       the symmetry matrix as (3x4) matrix
       the symbol as printed in the International Tables
       the resulting atom positions xyz, as printed in the International Tables

   For each symmetry operation DISCUS lists the number in square brackets,
   and for centered space groups the number within each block that corresponds
   to one centering vector in round brackets. With the setting 
   ==> set generator,symmetry the sequence corresponds to that listed
   in the Tables.

!p "symbol"

   This produces a short list that consists of the symbol as used in the
   International Tables.

!p "xyz"

   This produces a short list that consists of the symbolic atom positions
   xyz, as used in the International Tables.

!p "matrix"

   This produces a list that consists of the (3x4) symmetry matrices.

2  bugs
!b Known bugs

   Here is a list of known bugs of DISCUS which are on our 'repair
   list':

!p - DISCUS hangs if the input is redirected from a file ('discus < file')
!p   and the prompt status is ON if command line editing is used. 
!p   Use 'set prompt,off' or 'set prompt,redirect' in the first
!p   line of the file to be redirected to avoid the problem.
2  domain

   This command branches to the domain menu level.

   Domains are understood as any group of atoms which is to replace
   part of the original structure. A domain may be encoded within the
   file in two different ways:
   A) A list of pseudoatoms
   B) A list of explicit domains

   The pseudoatom file structure is identical to any DISCUS structure 
   file. The atoms are interpreted as positions of the domains within 
   the host structure. Size, character, and orientation of the domain
   can be set by the user via the 'assign' commands at the domain level.

   The domain lists encode the size, character, and orientation within 
   the file itself.

   Valid commands at this sublevel are:
3  commands

!p assign     ! Assigns size, character etc to the pseudoatoms
!p inputfile  ! Defines the input file name
!p mode       ! Defines the interpretation of the input file 
!p run        ! Perform the actual replacement
!p set        ! Sets various definitions
!p show       ! Show current settings

3  Instructions on usage

   These are some quick hints on how to use the domain level.

   An explicit domain is encoded similar to a molecule:

   domain
   domain character,domain_fuzzy
   domain file,domain_a.stru
   domain fuzzy,0.8
   posi      0.0000     0.0000    0.0000  0.000
   xaxi      1.0000     0.0000    0.0000  1.000
   yaxi      0.0000     1.0000    0.0000  1.000
   zaxi      0.0000     0.0000    1.0000  1.000
   cent      0.0000     0.0000    0.0000  0.000
   xdim      1.0000     0.0000    0.0000  1.000
   ydim      0.0000     1.0000    0.0000  1.000
   zdim      0.0000     0.0000    1.0000  1.000
   domain end

   This encoding allows you to use all of the DISCUS tools to create a
   distribution of domains within the host crystal. An alternative 
   encoding is the use of "pseudoatoms". These are regular atoms, which are
   interpreted by the domain level as positions of a domain.

   See the ==> 'insert' command for instructions to insert a domain into
   a dummy structure.

   The domain character may be any of "domain_cube", "domain_cylinder",
   "domain_fuzzy", or "domain_sphere". 
   A "domain_cube" is a cube with dimensions given by the xdim, ydim,
   and zdim dimensions. These values are elements of a distortion matrix
   which allows you to rotate and distort the cube.
   A "domain_cylinder" is a cylindrical domain. The initial rotation 
   axis is parallel to the z-axis.
   A "domain_fuzzy" domain has no predefined boundary. DISCUS reads all
   corresponding atoms from the file and deletes all host atoms, that 
   are less than the fuzzy separation away from any of the domain atoms.
   A "domain_sphere" is an initially spherical domain.

   A domain replaces all atoms that exist prior within the crystal. 
   The exception are those atoms with special names that define a
   domain or an object. These atoms are not replaced by a new domain.
   This allows you to replace a structure in part with other domains,
   where these domains remain intact, even if they overlap.


   See the manual for full details.

   The file contains the actual atoms that will be inserted into the 
   host structure. You must make sure that the atoms from this file to
   fill out the space freed by the domain.

   The fuzzy value gives the minimum distance between domain atoms and
   host atoms. Any atom closer than this separation is deleted for the
   host structure.
   If the fuzzy distance is set to zero or a negative value, the check
   is not performed and all old host atoms remain in the structure.

   The "posi" line is understood as the center of the domain atoms,
   the following three lines as the transformation matrix. The actual
   position onto which the domain atom is placed is calculated as:
   (t11  t12  t13 ) (xcoordinate)   (posi(x))
   (t21  t22  t23 ) (ycoordinate) + (posi(y))
   (t31  t32  t33 ) (zcoordinate)   (posi(z))
   
   Each of the matrix elements is calculated as follows:
   t11 = xaxi(x) - posi(x)
   t12 = xaxi(y) - posi(y)
   ..
   t21 = yaxi(x) - posi(x)
   ..
   Thus the transformation matrix is actually encoded by adding the 
   position to all matrix elements. This seemingly complication actually
   allows you to modify the domain by all DISCUS elements like the 
   generalized symmetry operation ==> 'symm'. A rotation for example will
   thus actually leave the matrix nicely intact.

   Likewise the next four lines are used to encode the transformation 
   matrix used to define the domain shape. Again, the actual transformation
   matrix is the difference between the lines "*dim" and the "cent" line.
   By increasing the dimension, you increase the domain size. You can 
   similaryl distort the domain shape. 

   The generalized symmetry level ==> "symm" allows you to change the
   position, orientation and shape of the domain and/or the atom transformation
   matrix. 
3  assign
!b assign "character",<pseudoatom name>,{"cube"|"cylinder"|"fuzzy"|"sphere"}
!b assign "content",<pseudoatom name>,<contentfile>
!b assign "fuzzy",<pseudoatom name>,<radius>
!b assign "orient",<pseudoatom name>,<row>,<ti1>,<ti2>,<ti3>,<ti4>
!b assign "shape",<pseudoatom name>,<row>,<ti1>,<ti2>,<ti3>,<ti4>

   These commands allow you to assign extended properties to the pseudo
   atoms. Since the pseudo atoms are identical to regular atoms, they can 
   only encode the position and type of a domain. The character, size, and
   orientation of the atoms with respect to the host structure may be 
   assigned via these commands.

!b assign "character",<pseudoatom name>,{"cube"|"cylinder"|"fuzzy"|"sphere"}

   A domain may be any of four different principal shapes. 
   The "cube" domain is a domain consisting of the six {100} faces. 
   The default distance of each face from the center is one respective
   unit cell. 
   A "cylinder" domain has cylindrical geometry with the default cylinder axis
   parallel to the c-axis. The radius is one b-axis length. Top and bottom
   are terminated by the two {001} faces.
   A "sphere" domain initially is spherical with radius one b-axis.

   All host atoms that are within the domain are removed, the void is 
   filled by the atoms from the corresponding <contentfile>. The size and
   shape of these domains may be changed by adjusting the 
   ==> ' assign shape' of the domain. 

   The "fuzzy" domain follows a very different concept. It does not have
   a predefined size or shape. Instead all atoms that are read from the 
   <contentfile> replace host atoms that are close to their position.

!b assign "content",<pseudoatom name>,<contentfile>

   The <contentfile> contains a DISCUS type structure file with all the
   atoms that are to be placed inside the host crystal. You need to make 
   sure that the structure listed in the <contetnfile> is large enough
   to fill the empty void created by the respective domain. 
   The space group and unit cell dimensions of the domain structure and 
   the host crystal must be identical.

!b assign "fuzzy",<pseudoatom name>,<radius>

   All host atoms that are closer than this <radius> to any of the 
   domain atoms are removed from the original host structure. This holds 
   for all domain character types.
   If the <radius> is set to zero or any negative number, the check is
   not performed for this domain type. Atoms of this domain type could
   thus be right on top of an atomof the host structure! 

!b assign "orient",<pseudoatom name>,<row_i>,<ti1>,<ti2>,<ti3>,<ti4>

   The orientation provides you a transformation matrix that is applied 
   to each domain atom prior to insertion into the host. 
   To keep the input lines short, each of the three rows <row_i> must
   be given separately.
   Each atom is transformed by:
   (t11  t12  t13 ) (xcoordinate)   (t14)   (posi(x))
   (t21  t22  t23 ) (ycoordinate) + (t24) + (posi(y))
   (t31  t32  t33 ) (zcoordinate)   (t34)   (posi(z))
   The translational part <ti4> is added to the position of the 
   pseudo atom.

!b assign "shape",<pseudoatom name>,<row>,<ti1>,<ti2>,<ti3>,<ti4>

   The shape transformation matrix is used to determine the size and shape
   of the domain. Default size at program start are +- one unit cell
   along each axis. Enlarge the domain by increasing the elements <tii>
   of the shape matrix, distort by changing the off-axis elements.
   The shape is distorted by:
   (t11  t12  t13 ) (xaxis)   (t14)   (posi(x))
   (t21  t22  t23 ) (yaxis) + (t24) + (posi(y))
   (t31  t32  t33 ) (zaxis)   (t34)   (posi(z))
   The translational part <ti4> is added to the position of the
   pseudo atom. The shape transformation works independent from the atom
   transformation matrix.
   If the character of the domain is "cube", "cylinder", or "sphere", 
   DISCUS checks whether the position of the domain atom after its 
   transformation fits into the domain shape. If true, it is inserted into
   the guest structure.
3  inputfile
!b inputfile <inputfile>

   DISCUS read the domain positions from the file <inputfile>. See the
   ==> 'mode' command on how DISCUS interprets this file.
3  mode
!b mode {"domain" | "pseudoatoms"}

   This command tells DISCUS how to interpret the input file. 
   With the "pseudoatoms" option, DISCUS expects to find a standard
   DISCUS structure file. Each "atom" in the file is interpreted as 
   a domain position. See the ==> 'assign' commands for further details.

   With the "domain" option DISCUS expects to read a file structured 
   like:
   A general header like all DISCUS structure files followed by as many 
   domain descriptors as needed. Each domain descriptor is designed 
   similarly to the molecule and object descriptors:

3  run
!b run

   This starts the actual incorporation of the domains into the host 
   crystal. The positions, characters etc. for each domain are read
   from file <inputfile>. The corresponding domain structure is used to
   replace part of the host structure.
3  set
!b set

   Set various definitions

4  distance
!b set distance, {"external" | "internal" |"all" }, <at_list>, <distance>

   Set the distances at wich an atom from the atom list shall be 
   considered to be close to a surface.
4  remove
!b set remove {"strict" | "initial" | "trust"}

   When DISCUS replaces (parts of) an old structure with the 
   content of domains. it needs to remove the old atoms. You have 
   three choices how this shall be done:

   strict
   Old atoms are removed EVERYTIME an individual domain is inserted
   into the crystal. Old atoms are considered to be all atoms that 
   were in the crystal just before this domain was inserted. This
   includes domains that were inserted by the very same 'run' 
   command. 
   You need to do this, if you suspect or know that domains do
   overlap. You must use this for example to simulate overgrowth of
   domains on top of each other.

   initial
   This time only those atoms are removed that were in the crystal 
   prior to the current 'run' command. The atoms that are inserted
   during the current 'run' command are not tested. They may overlap
   if you are not cereful. 

   trust
   OK, you trust that no domains overlap with each other and that you
   know exactly which host atoms have to be removed. The removal is
   performed after all domains have been inserted. DISCUS collects 
   all fuzzy distances from the ==> assign commands and uses the 
   maximum value of any assign command. This is necessary, since at this 
   point the information from which domain type a new atom was taken
   has been lost.
   This removal is MUCH faster than  the previous two.

   none
   The ultimate trust! No host atoms are removed at all. You can do this,
   if you read a crystal that consisted only of dummy atoms and each of 
   these represents a domain. 
   You should remove these dummy atoms after you leave the 'domain'
   menu via a ==> replace dummy, void, all,1.0 command.
   This combination is the fastest but be advised that you really need to
   know where the dummy atoms and the inserted atoms are. Otherwise you
   might end up with lots of strange overlapping atoms.

2  errors

   The program has been written such that it should handle almost
   any typing error when giving commands and hopefully all errors
   that result from calculation with erroneous data. When an error
   is found an error message is displayed that should get you back
   on track. See the manual for a complete list of error messages.

   Error messages concerning the command language are explained in
   the -> command language section of the online help. Application
   specific commands are described here and are grouped as follows:

!p APPL   Errors specific to DISCUS usage
!p CHEM   Errors at the chemistry sublevel
!p FOUR   Errors related to Fourier Transform
!p MMC    Errors at the Monte Carlo level
!p PDF    Errors at the PDF level
!p RMC    Errors at the Reverse Monte Carlo level

   Each error message is displayed together with the corresponding
   category <cccc> and the error number <numb> in the form:

!b ****CCCC****message                    **** numb ****

   Type
   help error <cccc> <numb>
   to get an explanation for the error message and hints for possible
   steps to correct the situation.

   In the default mode DISCUS returns the standard prompt and you can 
   continue the execution from this point. You can set the error status
   to "exit" by the ==>'set' command. In this case DISCUS terminates 
   if an error is detected. This option is useful to terminate a faulty
   sequence of commands when running DISCUS in the batch mode of your
   operating system.
   If you are a bit more daring, you can use the "live" error setting.
   With this setting, DISCUS will continue to run a macro after an 
   error has occured. This is helpful if you attempt to read a file
   of unknown length with ==> 'fget' and need to catch the EOF signal.
   Oter than that be careful!

3  appl

   This category lists error messages that are specific to DISCUS usage.
   You will find error messages regarding improper usage of atoms, 
   space group violations, etc.

4  -1
   Maximum number of Orient. matrices read

   The maximum number of orientation matrices that can be used for 
   microdomains is limited by the parameter "MAX_MD_ORI" in the file
   "microdis.inc". If necessary adjust this parameter and recompile the 
   program.
4  -2
   Improper limits for atom number

   Either of the upper or lower limits used on the 'append' command is 
   outside the range of atoms present in the crystal. Check whether 
   the limits are both positive, the upper limit is higher or equal to 
   the lower limit and whether both limits are less or equal to the 
   number of atoms present in the crystal. The number of atoms in the 
   crystal can be checked with the command: "eval n[1]". 
4  -3
   No atoms selected yet

   The plot and waves can only be run for selected atoms. Use the 'select' 
   command to select individual atom types or to select all atoms present 
   in the crystal. 
4  -4
   Extend of plotspace is zero

   The dimensions of the space from which atoms are to be plotted is zero. 
   Check the values displayed by the plot 'show' command and use the 
   'exte' command to give appropriate values.
4  -5
   Too many microdomains within crystal

   DISCUS stores all microdomain positions in an array. The size of
   this array is defined by parameter MC_MAXMICRO in file "microdis.inc".
   If necessary readjust the value of this parameter and recompile the 
   program. 
4  -6
   Unknown microdomain type

   The microdomain type number used with the 'place' command does not 
   correspond to an existing microdomain type in the list. Check with 
   'show types' for a list of microdomain types that have been inserted 
   into the list of available microdomains.
4  -7
   Unknown space group symbol         

   The crystal file contains an unknown space group. Check the spelling of 
   the space group symbol. The allowed space groups are all 230 space 
   groups in the Int. Tables for Crystallography plus the space groups 
   given for alternative settings and cell choices of the monoclinic 
   space groups. 
   Refer to appendix A of the manual for a complete listing of space
   group symbols.
4  -8
   Too many points in reciprocal layer

   The number of points in reciprocal space that can be calculated by the
   Fourier transform is limited by the parameter "MAXQXY" in the file
   "qspace.inc". Check that the product of <na> and <no> is less or equal
   to "MAXQXY". If necessary adjust the parameter "MAXQXY" and recompile
   the program.
4  -9
   Unknown Output Format   

   An unknown output format was defined for the output level. Check 
   that either of: "stan", "gnu", "pgm" or "post" was used as output 
   format with the 'format' command. 
4  -10
   Too many Atoms in crystal

   The maximum number of atoms that can be stored in the structure 
   is determined by the parameter MAXATOMS in the file "crystal.inc". 
   By inserting new atoms or by defining too large a crystal on the 
   'read' command, this number was exceeded. If necessary, change the 
   value of the parameter MAXATOMS and recompile the program. 
4  -11
   Unknown threshold type
   The parameter given on the 'thresh' command does not correspond to 
   a valid entry. Check the spelling of the parameter.
4  -12
   Number of points must be > zero

   The value of the parameter given on the 'abs' or 'ord' command is
   less than one. This value represents the number of data points
   calculated along the respective direction. 
   The value must be at least one or higher.
4  -13
   Correlation matrix index outside limits

   The index of the correlation matrix element(s) is either less than
   one or higher than the number of defined microdomain types.
   Check the 'ccol', 'crow' and 'cele' commands for proper number of
   parameters. Use the 'show type' command at 'microdomain' sub level
   to see the number of microdomains currently defined.
4  -14
   Invalid space group & lattice constants

   While reading a new cell the program checks the space group and the 
   lattice constants for consistency. Either a space group was given 
   that is not included in the program, or the lattice constants do 
   not fulfill the constraints imposed by the space group. Check the 
   space group symbol and the lattice constants given in the input file. 
4  -15
   No microdomain input file name defined

   An attempt was made to insert a microdomain type without specifying
   the input file name. With the exception of content type 'free' all
   microdomains require an input file from which the new atom positions
   are read.
   Check the current defaults by 'show def' and the parameters given on
   then 'cont' command.
4  -16
   Status for log must be : "on" or "off"

   The second parameter for the 'log' command must be either "on" or
   "off".
4  -17
   Index of matrix outside limits

   The first parameter on the 'mrow' command is the index of the row
   that is to be inserted. Allowed values are one, two or three.
4  -18
   No orientation with this number exists

   The orientation matrix requested as parameter on the 'orie' command
   does not exist. Use the 'show orie' command to view the list of
   defined orientation matrices. Check whether three 'mrow' commands
   were used for each orientation matrix that you intended to set up.
4  -19
   Atom number outside limits

   The number of the atom is either less than one, larger than the current
   number of atoms in the crystal or even larger than the maximum 
   number of atoms allowed in your implementation.
   Check the value of the parameter(s) on the 'remove' and 'switch'
   commands or check the index of the variables "m", "x", "y" or "z".
   Check the number of atoms present in the crystal by the command:
   'eval n[1]'.
4  -20
   Unknown element, no Fourier calculated

   An element was detected in the list of atoms for which there is no 
   scattering curve available. The Fourier transform is not calculated 
   at all. Check the name of all atoms present in the crystal using 
   the 'asym' and 'chem' commands. If a charged ion was given, this 
   valence might not be present in the list of scattering curves. 
   Refer to Appendix b of the manual for a list of internally stored 
   names.
   If the 'scat' and/or 'delf' commands were used, any name may be used.
   Check whether the commands were used properly.
4  -21
   No element present, no Fourier calculated

   There are no elements present at all in the crystal. The Fourier 
   transform is not calculated at all. Most likely, the Fourier 
   was called before a structure or unit cell was read, or an error 
   occurred during the reading of the structure or unit cell. 
4  -22
   Incompatible standard file sizes

   While attempting to add two Standard files, DISCUS encountered
   different length of rows or columns in the two input files. The 
   adding is interrupted at this stage. The indices along the
   abscissa and ordinate at which the error occurred, is displayed
   as well, check the input file for erroneous content.
   Also check, whether the parameters nx,ny in the two input files
   are identical as well as the xmin,xmax,ymin and ymax parameters
   in the second line of both input files. 
4  -23
   Incompatible GNUPLOT file sizes

   While attempting to add two GNUPLOT files, DISCUS encountered
   different length of rows or columns in the two input files. The
   adding is interrupted at this stage. The line number in which
   the error occurred, is displayed as well, check the input file
   for erroneous content.
4  -24
   Different coordinates in GNUPLOT files

   While attempting to add two GNUPLOT files, DISCUS encountered
   different coordinates in the two input files. The adding 
   is interrupted at this stage. The line number in which the
   error occurred, is displayed as well, check the input file for
   erroneous content.
4  -25
   Different coordinates in 1-dim files

   While attempting to add two 1-dim files, DISCUS encountered different
   coordinates in the two input files. The adding is interrupted at this
   stage.The line number in which the error occurred, is displayed as
   well, check the input file for erroneous content.
4  -26
   Too many different atoms in crystal

   The maximum number of different atoms allowed in your implementation 
   was exceeded. No more new types of atoms can be inserted into the
   structure. Check the chemistry of your crystal by the 'asym' and
   'chem' commands. All atoms are considered different types that are
   chemically different, have different charge or a different temperature
   coefficient. If all types are needed, modify the parameter "maxscat"
   in the file "param.inc" and recompile the program. See chapter 9.1
   of the manual for further information. 
4  -27
   No atom of this type present in crystal

   An atom was selected for displacement by a wave or for plotting that 
   does not exist within the crystal. Check the spelling of the atom 
   name, and the chemistry of the crystal by the 'asym' and 'chem' 
   commands. 
4  -28
   Input parameters must be > zero

   This function/command requires non-negative parameters.
   Check the values of the parameters and the explanation for the function
   or command used for valid ranges of numerical input.
4  -29
   Too many different microdomain types

   The maximum number of microdomain types is defined by the parameter 
   MAX_MD_TY in file "microdis.inc". If necessary adjust this parameter 
   and recompile the program. 
4  -30
   Unknown boundary type

   The boundary type of microdomains is not set to either of "block", 
   "face", "fuzzy" or "sphere". Check the 'boundary' command at sublevel 
   'microdomains' for proper spelling. 
4  -31
   Unknown distribution mode

   The distribution type for microdomains is not set to either of 
   "lattice", "paracrystal" or "random". Check the 'distribution' command 
   at sublevel 'microdomains' for proper spelling. 
4  -32
   Length of vector is zero

   An attempt was made to calculate the angle between two vectors 
   while one of them is of length zero. Check the parameters given 
   on the 'bang' or 'rang' command for proper numbers. 
4  -33
   No microdomain types defined yet

   An attempt was made to use the 'create' or 'run' command before 
   any microdomains were defined by the 'insert' command. Check for 
   proper sequence of commands and missing or misspelled 'insert' commands. 
4  -34
   Form does not appear to be closed

   A microdomain type of boundary type 'face' was defined for which 
   the form supplied by the 'bound' command does appear not to be closed. 
   DISCUS checks whether the origin of the microdomain is inside the
   microdomain and the positions at 1.0*10**9 along each of the base
   vectors is outside the microdomain. If one of these conditions is
   not met, the error message is given. Check the 'boundary' commands
   used to define the microdomain type. 
4  -35
   Volume of unit cell <= zero

   The volume of the unit cell was calculated as zero or a negative
   value.
   Check the lattice parameters given in the input file. Are there
   any accidental "-" signs ? Do the angles form an impossible shape ?
4  -36
   Unsuitable file types for inverse Fourier

   Not every combination of file types is allowed for an inverse
   Fourier synthesis. Allowed file combinations are:

!p   file  a     file b
!p   intensity   phase
!p   amplitude   phase
!p   real part   imaginary part
4  -37
   No filename defined yet            

   An attempt was made to write output to or read from a file without 
   defining a file name. DISCUS does not provide default names for the
   output of the 'plot' command or the input filenames. Check the
   'outfile' command at sublevels 'output' and 'plot' or the 'content'
   command at sublevel 'microdomains'. 
4  -38
   Unsuitable file types for Patterson

   Not every combination of file types is allowed for a Patterson
   synthesis. Allowed file combinations are:

!p   file  a     file b
!p   intensity   any file type
!p   amplitude   any file type
!p   real part   imaginary part
4  -39
   All elements of correlation matrix zero

   Since the correlation matrix gives the probabilities for existence 
   of a microdomain type, not all elements may be equal to zero. The 
   default values at startup are 1 for the diagonal elements and zero 
   for all other elements. display the correlation matrix with the
   command 'show corr' and check the 'ccol', 'cele' and 'crow' commands 
   for proper values. 
4  -40
   Microdomain type cannot be removed

   DISCUS can only remove those microdomain types from the list of types 
   that have not yet been used by the 'create' command, i.e. only those
   microdomain types that have been inserted into the list by the 'insert'
   command after the last 'create' command. 
4  -41
   File specifier must be "a" or "b"

   The two files for inverse Fourier and Patterson synthesis are
   referred to by "a" and "b". The first parameter on the 'file' and
   the 'type' commands must be either "a" or "b".
4  -42
   Type must be: inten,ampl,phase,real,imag

   The file type for inverse Fourier and Patterson synthesis must be
   specified as one of the following strings:
   "intensity","amplitude","phase","real","imaginary"
   They may be abbreviated to a unique string.

   Check the spelling of the parameter.
4  -43
   Not enough parameter for filename format

   An attempt was made to generate a file name from a string like
   "text%dtext" without supplying enough numerical parameters.
   Check that the spelling of the sting within " " is correct. Are 
   there any unwanted %d combinations?. Check the number and type
   of parameters following the file name.
4  -44
   Right quotation mark missing in format

   An attempt was made to generate a file name from a string like
   "text%dtext" without supplying the right quotation mark.
   Check the line and provide the missing ".
4  -45
   Too many atoms in environment

   The indices of all atoms found are stored in the internal variable
   "res". More atoms were found that fit into the dimensions of "res".
   Restrict the search for the environment to a smaller shell or
   change the dimension of "res_para" in file "param.inc".
4  -46
   Error reading title of structure

   An error occurred while reading the title line of a structure or
   unit cell file. Check the file for any garbage.
4  -47
   Error reading space group symbol

   An error occurred while reading the space group  line of a structure or
   unit cell file. Check the file for any garbage.
4  -48
   Error reading lattice constants

   An error occurred while reading the lattice constants of a structure
   or unit cell file. Check the file for any garbage or accidental letters.
4  -49
   Error reading atom coordinates

   An error occurred while reading the atom coordinates of the atom 
   listed.  Check the file for any garbage. Is the line of the type
   Name x y z B
   Are there letters among the numerical values?
4  -50
   Wrong format for 1-dimensional data

   You tried to write a one-dimensional section of space as either
   Postscript, PGM or PPM Bitmap. One-dimensional data can only be
   written as "gnuplot" or "standard" format.
4  -51
   Unsuitable file type for SHELXL format

   If the file format is set to "shelxl" to calculate the inverse Fourier of
   Patterson form SHELXL data, the file type must be set to either of
   "fobs" or "fcalc".

   Check the 'type' command for erroneous input.
4  -52
   Unsuitable input value for SHELXL format

   If the file format is set to "shelxl" to calculate the inverse Fourier of
   Patterson form SHELXL data, the optional second parameter must be either of
   "fobs" or "fcalc".
   Check the input line for the 'form' command.
4  -53
   Too many different layer types

   You tried to define too many different layer types for a crystal with
   stacking faults.

   If necessary modify the value of "ST_MAXTYPE" in file "stack.inc"
   and compile the program.
4  -54
   Index outside limits

   The value given is outside the proper limits allowed by this command.
   This usually means that an array element is outside the current
   dimension of an array, for example a correlation matrix or you are
   trying to include too many atoms in the crystal. Check the section
   on dimensions in the manual.
4  -55
   No layers created at all

   During the creation of the stacking faults, none of the layer types
   met the conditions imposed by the correlation matrix. Check the
   correlation matrix for proper values.
4  -56
   Av. Transl. in plane of moduli vectors

   The average translation vector, - calculated from the matrix of
   translation vectors and the correlation matrix or read via the 'aver'
   command is in the plane defined by the two moduli vector that were
   read using the 'modu' command. 
   Use the 'show' command to check the values of the vectors. Correct
   the vectors by the 'aver', 'modu' commands.
4  -57
   Av. Translation is zero

   The average translation vector is a vector of length zero. 
   Use the 'show' command to check the values of the vector.
   If the average vector is set explicitly by ==> 'set trans,fixed', then
   correct the vector by the 'aver' command. 
   If the average vector is calculated from the translation and correlation
   matrix, the weighted sum of translation vectors is equal to zero.
   Use the 'show' command to check the values of the two matrices. 
   Correct the values by the ==> 'trans', 'crow', 'ccol', 'cele' commands.
4  -58
   No atoms written to file

   No atoms were written to the plot file after the run command. Check
   the settings using the command 'show' and check the online help for
   further details. The most common problem is a too small value for
   'thick'.
4  -59
   Invalid color or typ selected for atom

   The color or type selected for plotting atoms is invalid. Check the
   online help for a list of valid numbers.
4  -60
   Output value NOT allowed using lots

   You calculated the Fourier using ==> 'lots'. In this case you can write
   intensities only as output.
4  -61
   Too many additional generators

   You tried to specify too many additional generators through the 
   "generator" key word in the structure file. The maximum number of 
   generators is specified in the file "gen_add.inc". If necessary, increase
   the value and compile DISCUS.
4  -62
   Too many additional symmetry operators

   You tried to specify too many additional symmetry operators through the
   "symmetry"  key word in the structure file. The maximum number of
   symmetry operators is specified in the file "gen_add.inc". If necessary,
   increase the value and compile DISCUS.
4  -63
   Molecule number outside limits

   You tried to select a molecule number that is less than zero or higher
   than the number of molecules in the crystal. Or the upper limit of a 
   range of numbers could be less than the lower limit.
4  -64
   Molecule type outside limits

   You tried to select a molecule type that is less than zero or higher
   than the number of molecule types in the crystal. Or the upper limit of a
   range of numbers could be less than the lower limit.
4  -65
   Too many molecules created

   You created more molecules than fit into the corresponding arrays. 
   Check the size of the crystal or the limits of loops used to create
   the molecules.
   If necessary adjust the maximum number of molecules in the file
   "molecule.inc" and compile DISCUS.
4  -66
   Too many molecules types created

   You created more molecule types than fit into the corresponding arrays. 
   Check the number of molecules in the crystal file or the limits of loops
   used to create the molecules.
   If necessary adjust the maximum number of molecule types in the file
   "molecule.inc" and compile DISCUS.
4  -67
   Molecules have different number of atoms

   You tried to swap two molecules of different length. This mode is
   possible for molecules of equal length only.
4  -68
   Mode only available for molecules

   Rotational waves are can act only onto molecules, not onto individual
   atoms
4  -69
   Microdomains overlap

   An atom was found that is inside at least two microdomains. The atom
   number and the microdomain numbers are written onto the screen.
   Check the distribution of the microdomains and the corresponding
   microdomain radii. Either the two microdomains are too close to each
   other or the radii of the microdomains are too large.
4  -70
   Delta value must be in interval 0 -> 1

   A wave function of type "box" was chosen. The optional second parameter
   gives the width of the lower half of the box in multiples of the 
   wave length. This value must be in the range 0 -> 1. The values 0 and 1
   are not allowed either.
4  -71
   Too many points in direct space layer

   The number of data points you selected with the 'rhona' and 'rhono'
   commands exceeds the maximum number of data points DISCUS can handle.
   The maximum value is defined in the variable MAXQXY in the file
   "config.inc". If necessary adjust this parameter and compile DISCUS
   again.
4  -72
   Too many atom types in file

   The nunmber of different atom types in the structure file is too
   large. Note that DISCUS treats atoms of the same name but with 
   different B values as different atom types. The maximum value
   is defined in the variable MAXSCAT in 'config.inc'. If necessary 
   adjust this parameter and compile DISCUS again.
4  -73
   Transform. requires too many generators

   The old symmetry operations of the space group are always changed into
   additional generators and the new space group is P1. This allows you 
   to generate the structure from the list of atoms in the old asymmetric
   unit without running into a conflict between the symmetry and the 
   unit cell shape.
   If you have transformed the old unit cell into an oddly shaped or into
   a very large new cell, the old translations will be transformed into 
   a very large number of generators.
4  -74
   Molecule atom-number outside limits

   The argument to the variable "mol_cont" is outside the number of 
   atoms in this molecule, i.e. negative or too large.
   Check the number of atoms in this molecule through "mol_cont[i1,0],
   where <i1> is the number of the molecule.
   If you are reading a crystal structure, then the number of atoms is
   too large to fit into the space allocated for molecules. Adjust the
   parameter MOLE_MAX_ATOM in the file "molecule.inc"
4  -75

   No bond valence parameters for atom pair
4  -76
   Function not available for molecules

   The selected items for the program ATOMS must be individual atoms,
   not molecules.
4  -77
   Unknown wave length symbol used

   You used a wave length symbol unknown to DISCUS. Check for a typing
   error and consult the list of allowed wave length symbols in the help
   file through "help wavelength". The wave length of nonlisted radiations
   must be explicitly given as real value in Angstroem. 
4  -78
   Wrong optional parameter for HKLF4 format
4  -79
   Too many atoms in result array

   Through finding environments or similar operations too many atoms
   were found. Reduce the radius of the environment that you are searching.
   Alternatively increase the size of the variable "MAXPAR_RES" in file
   "param.inc"
4  -80
   Angle between Normal and Abszissa is 0

   The angle between the normal and the abszissa of the plot is 
   zero degrees. Check the values you selected with the ==> 'uvw', 'hkl'
   and ==> 'abs' commands, and verify the angle in the ==> 'show'
   output.
4  -81
   Invalid flag for space type

   Commands like ==> 'projection' and the ==> 'function' "scalpro" take
   an optional flag that indicates whether the vectors are to be taken 
   from direct or reciprocal space. Accordingly the flags are 2 to 4
   characters long and may contain only the letters "d" and "r".
4  -82
   Invalid molecule character

   The character keyword for a molecule may only be "atom". 
   If the molecule represents an extended object, used in small angle 
   scattering calculations, it may be "cube", "cylinder", or
   "sphere".
